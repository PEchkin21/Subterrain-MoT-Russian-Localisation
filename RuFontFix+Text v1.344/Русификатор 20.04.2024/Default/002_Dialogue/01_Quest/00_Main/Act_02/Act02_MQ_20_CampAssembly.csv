#,Main Quest: Camp Assembly

#,Purpose: [Camp Management] Activation. // Hub Elevator repaired.
#,"Place: Pub, Front of hub elevator."
#,"Actor: Tau Mogorosi, Ida Shahane, Alp Demir, Gin Lao, Litzi Vogl, Judith Taggart, Seoyeon Nam, Earl Running Wolf, Claudia Flores, David Almanza"
#,KeyPrefix: Act02_MQ_20

#,"After defeating boss 1, after talk with Seble and others, fades out."
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_01,"(While Alexei and Seble tend to the shaft damage, you make your way to Alp's Pub.)"

#,(Fades in. Department heads are gathered in the pub for an assembly talk.)
#,Tau talks about the event and makes excuses. Wanting to get paid more.
#,Others talk about the grim situation. Ida suggests that player can get down to the underground
#,There is idea of fixing the elevator by the hub to get down by it and get to the mine through residential area
#,"Repair work is agreed, and the assembly ends"
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_02,"(Uneasy voices fill the Pub as you enter, followed by grim expressions as your eyes adjust to the fluorescent lights. Tau is already explaining away what happened in the Mine Control facility. Tau beckons you to stand in the middle of the gathering.)"
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_03,"Well, if you don't believe me... go on, kid, tell 'em what you saw."
Act02_MQ_20_Lao_04,Did you really see a monster at the mine elevator?
Act02_MQ_20_Player_05,"Tau is telling the truth. The four of us - myself, Tau, Alexei, and Seble - all saw it."
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_06,(A palpable chill fills the room as everyone experiences true terror.)
Act02_MQ_20_Alp_07,"This is terrible... The cave posed some danger, sure, but now there are monsters right under our feet? It's just too much."
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_08,"It might sound crazy, but isn't this why we have security? Claudia?"
Act02_MQ_20_Claudia_09,"We defend the camp just fine. It sounds like you miners were dangling the newbie as bait, just waiting for something to attack."
Act02_MQ_20_Player_10,That's not true! I was going to enter the mine.
Act02_MQ_20_Claudia_11,<b>Bullshit!</b> It's not just the new monsters down there. Need I remind everyone of the contamination? I say we just seal that hole and be done with it.
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_12,Seble and Alexei are already fixing the elevator. The stuff down there is too valuable to shut it down.
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_13,Says the guy who will most certainly not be going down himself.
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_14,"Regardless of who actually goes into the mine, I'm the one in charge of the mine, so we need to start discussing our payment for doing Security's job!"
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_15,"And Tau's true motive finally reveals itself! If it weren't for {PlayerFullName}, I'd think you were just spewing BS to get your hands on more credits. That's all you really care about."
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_16,"If it weren't for me and the new kid, you'd all be dead. We kept it from ravaging the entire camp, so yes... I believe there should be compensation."
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_17,"(You shake your head, but you dare not get in the middle of their bad blood)"
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_18,"Closing the mine hurt my miners the most, forcing us to go work in different departments. It's not unreasonable to be paid for going above and beyond. We need to keep the operation going, right?"
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_19,Cut the crap! Everyone is hurt by this! 

Act02_MQ_20_Lao_21,"Okay, okay, you're both special snowflakes. Can we please put a pin in this spat?"
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_22,"(Tau and Judith grumble under their breath, but allow the assembly to continue.)"
Act02_MQ_20_Lao_23,"Now, I'll point out that we have no idea what is happening in the mines or when those creatures might come up again. Claudia's suggestion of sealing the mine isn't terrible from my standpoint, but I'm hoping there's another path forward."
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_24,"I hate to say this, but I must begrudgingly agree with Tau. Not about the credits, but the information in the mine could help us cure our people and find out why the past expedition disappeared. We can't just throw that away. "

Act02_MQ_20_David_26,"Agreed. I don't know if sealing the mine is even really an option. Without it, we're severely draining our supplies. The mine is dangerous, yes, but it could also revive the camp if we could figure out a way to reenter safely.  "
Act02_MQ_20_Litzi_27,"To bolster David's point, our fuel reserves are scarily low. Something has to change, or we will run out of power. Small trips to the caves just aren't enough anymore."
Act02_MQ_20_Wolf_28,"The water station is in a similar situation, sadly. We can only ration so much before there's nothing left. "
Act02_MQ_20_Seo-Yeon_29,"Same for the farm, which is further affected by the water shortage in a big way. "
Act02_MQ_20_David_30,"And no communication with TECC HQ means we have to solve this one ourselves, at least in the short term. "

Act02_MQ_20_Tau_32,So what? Is your solution to just sit around waiting to die?
Act02_MQ_20_Player_33,Definitely not! But that's why it's important that I go down there!
Act02_MQ_20_Claudia_34,Wait... You were serious about that? Entering the mine is a death sentence.
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_35,Actually...
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_36,(Everyone's attention turns to Ida.)
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_37,"No one reads their communications. *sigh* I'll just explain it... After intense experimentation, I've discovered that {PlayerFullName}'s unique nanobots provide a limited resistance to the mine's contamination."
Act02_MQ_20_Wolf_38,Really?
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_39,(You nod to back Doctor Shahane up.)
Act02_MQ_20_Lao_40,"If that's true, then there may still be hope. How long until the main shaft is in working order?"
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_41,"My team is the best, but even then... it's gonna be a while. "
Act02_MQ_20_David_42,"What about the service elevator in the main hallway? I believe there is a connection to the mine from the basement level, but it's been down for weeks."
Act02_MQ_20_Lao_43,"Judith, do you think it's possible to repair it quickly?"
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_44,"I'll give it my best, but there's no guarantee the power is flowing to the basement. Give me a hand, Litzi?"
Act02_MQ_20_Litzi_45,"Tell me what you need, and my crew is there. "
Act02_MQ_20_Lao_46,Then we have a plan. We will reassemble when Judith and Litzi are done. This assembly is over for now.

#,"Assembly is ended, and fades out to cut scene"

#,"Fades in with Judith, Litzi, Tau, and Ida in front of repaired hub elevator."
#,Tau keeps on going about getting paid more.
#,Ida reminds player what is stake and what player needs to look for underground.
#,Others also agree to give player permission to adjust camp's resource management.
#,Judith also gives some blueprint to start producing more advanced range weaponry such as guns.
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_56,"(Judith calls everyone to the elevator once repairs are complete. It's a rush job, but looks functional, at least.)"
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_57,"It took some work, but you can take the elevator down when you're ready."
Act02_MQ_20_Lao_58,Fortune shines on us today.
Act02_MQ_20_Litzi_59,Odette and Fang worked overtime to reroute power to the basement but couldn't extend it any deeper. Try to find the cause; Electricity will make life a lot easier down there.
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_60,"The mining crew will monitor the elevator on our side, so if you need to come back up just ping us and we'll pull the lever. "
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_61,What are you talking about?
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_62,"Seble did the quality check on your shoddy work. Turns out it's a one-way trip unless someone brings the elevator back up manually. Since this is our operation, we'll handle that duty."
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_63,(Judith and Tau glare at each other. One truly never misses the opportunity to undercut the other. Mr. Lao jumps in to calm the situation.)
Act02_MQ_20_Lao_64,"Okay... Tau, you handle elevator duty, and the camp will transfer the proper credits to your crew's accounts after your debts to Judith are fully paid. Then we can hopefully consider this squabble settled. Yes?"
Act02_MQ_20_Tau&Judith_65,Fine.
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_66,"Mind if I interrupt? {PlayerFullName}, it's crucial for you to <color=#FFFF00>bring back anything usable for the camp</color>. We're all hurting around here."
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_67,"Every department has been managing its own supply levels, which has also put us against each other. With that in mind, our methods of production and consumption need to change fundamentally."
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_68,"So, after careful consideration and discussion, the assembly has decided to give you complete authority to manage the camp's resources. This decision was not unanimous but is final, so you shouldn't receive any pushback. Everything you bring back will replenish our reserves and help us survive, and you get to choose how to allocate it. "
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_69,"(Ida connects to your Omniscope and uploads new permissions, along with instructions, urgent needs, and tangential information you may find interesting.)"
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_70,"Full access to <color=#FFA500>Resource Production and Utilization</color> is now yours. This is a critical responsibility, but we also can't trust anyone else to fairly distribute resources without bias for their own department."
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_71,"For the record, three of the four department heads here voted for you. Just sayin'."
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_72,"Hey, real talk: I would have been a perfect choice, but I don't hold no grudges... unlike some people. "
Act02_MQ_20_Nar_73,"(Mr. Lao, Litzi, and Ida roll their eyes, annoyed that the squabbles are apparently to continue after all.)"
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_74,"Okay, okay, next. Be careful when traveling in heavily contaminated areas. You're resistant, not impervious. Your Omniscope will alert you to <color=#FFA500>Contamination Levels</color>. The assumption right now is that the deeper you go... the higher the levels will be."
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_75,"Finally, you should run into facilities built by the previous expeditions, your old team. We couldn't fully excavate them due to contamination, so searching those areas and finding clues might reveal what happened to Titan."
Act02_MQ_20_Player_76,"So, in summation: I'm in charge of gathering all the resources I can, and I get to decide where they go in camp. No pressure there. "
Act02_MQ_20_Player_77,"I also need to collect everything while looking for clues from my past, fighting monsters, and keeping an eye on my contamination levels."
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_78,"In a nutshell, yes. You're going to do great!"
Act02_MQ_20_Player_79,"Thank you, Doctor Shahane."
Act02_MQ_20_Ida_80,Hey... call me Ida. *smile*
Act02_MQ_20_Tau_81,"Also keep in mind that we don't really know what's down there. You said you were ready before, but check yourself before you actually go in."
Act02_MQ_20_Judith_82,I also put <color=#66FFCC>Blueprints</color> in your storage for some ranged weapons. Physical contact with things down there could be hazardous. 
Act02_MQ_20_Lao_83,"And with that, we all wish you great success. Do check in if you need anything else. We are all here to support you."
Act02_MQ_20_AI_84,<color=#FFA500>Camp Management</color> information and permission has been updated. You can check the <color=#FFA500>Camp UI</color> by using {KeyboardControl_Camp}key.
