#,"개인 창고 앞에 위치하고, 창고에 대한 설명 시작."
#,(Screen fades and then player and David appear in front of storage box location.)
Act01_MQ_04_01_PersonalStorage_Nar_01,"(David leads you to a long red box outside his office. It is protected by heavy locks and anti-theft protective measures which deactivate as you approach, reacting to the presence of your Omniscope.)"
Act01_MQ_04_01_PersonalStorage_David_02,"You can also store anything you own in this <color=#FFA500>Storage</color> box to avoid having to lug it around. There are several of these around camp, but your personal items are coded to your Omniscope, so no one can steal them."
Act01_MQ_04_01_PersonalStorage_David_03,"Even better, Camp Huygen was established as a processing settlement, so you won't be surprised that we have one of the most sophisticated production systems around. You can take almost anything and turn it into something useful. "

#,"아이템 작업에 대한 설명 시작."
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_David_01,Let me explain how to use our Item Production pipeline before I let you go. It's pretty essential to life here in camp.

#,"Junk 아이템을 건넴."
#,"Take some junk I had lying around., and here's a blueprint, too! "
Act01_MQ_04_01_GiveItem_David_01,"For starters, grab that junk next to you. "
Act01_MQ_04_01_GiveItem_Nar_02,(You receive <color=#66FFCC>Pile of Junk</color>.)

#,아이템 작업에 대한 설명.
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_Player_02,Got it. What's next?
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_David_03,"Once you've collected some items, you can put them into your <color=#FFA500>Storage</color> and then perform one of three requests. "
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_David_04,"The <color=#FFA500>Craft</color> request spits out a brand spanking new item, anything from better gear to medicine."
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_David_05,The <color=#FFA500>Research</color> request unlocks more things to be crafted by analyzing blueprints and other researchable items. 
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_David_06,"The <color=#FFA500>Recycle</color> option is my favorite because it takes an item and breaks it down into its most usable parts. Then, you can use those new pieces to Craft."
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_Player_07,"Sounds a bit confusing. Remember, I just woke up after years in a tube."
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_David_08,"No worries. If you need to remember how to do it, just check out <color=#FFA500>[Journal] - [Guide]</color> in your Omniscope for a refresher. "
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_Player_09,"Oh, good. Thank you for that. "
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_David_10,"Plus, what better way to learn than doing it right now? Go to your personal <color=#FFA500>Storage</color>, then open the <color=#FFA500>Item Production</color> menu and <color=#FFA500>Recycle</color> the <color=#66FFCC>Pile of Junk</color> you picked up. "
Act01_MQ_04_01_Production_Player_11,Let's give it a shot.

#,플레이어가 아이템 작업을 완료하지 않고 시설을 떠나려는 경우 발생.
#,Player tries to leave supply depot before completing production tutorial.
Act01_MQ_04_01_RoomBlock_David_01,"My job is to make sure you can use the production system. Try it out before you leave, please."
Act01_MQ_04_01_RoomBlock_Nar_02,(David's only letting you leave once you produce a new item.)

#,"분해에 필요한 Junk 아이템을 개인 창고에 넣었을 때."
M_Q_04_01_JunkStorage_Nar_01,"(As you put the item in storage, David pops out to talk to you.)"
M_Q_04_01_JunkStorage_David_02,"Well done. For any research, recycling and crafting requests, put all the necessary items in there to begin with."
M_Q_04_01_JunkStorage_David_03,"Open the <color=#FFA500>Item Production</color> menu and <color=#FFA500>Recycle</color> the <color=#66FFCC>Pile of Junk</color> you stored."
M_Q_04_01_JunkStorage_Player_04,"Let's give it a shot."

#,"아이템 분해를 완료했을 때"
#,"When recycling is done, David reappear. Once conversation is over, Research guide is triggered and David disappears again."
M_Q_04_01_RecycleDone_Nar_01,"(After you're done with the <color=#FFA500>Recycling</color> process, David pops out to praise you.)"
M_Q_04_01_RecycleDone_David_02,"Good job! Now you have the materials you need to make something. Next, let's <color=#FFA500>Research</color> an item."
M_Q_04_01_RecycleDone_David_03,"Take this blueprint, place it into your personal <color=#FFA500>Storage</color>, bring up the <color=#FFA500>Item Production</color> menu, and select the <color=#FFA500>Research</color> icon."
M_Q_04_01_RecycleDone_Nar_04,(You received <color=#66FFCC>Blueprint: Bear Trap</color>.)

#,"아이템 연구를 완료했을 때."
#,"Once research is done, David reappear. Once conversation is over, Crafting guide is triggered and David disappears again."
M_Q_04_01_ResearchDone_Nar_01,"(Once your <color=#FFA500>Research</color> is completed, David shows up again... almost like he was lurking nearby.)"
M_Q_04_01_ResearchDone_David_02,Great! The last step is to actually <color=#FFA500>Craft</color> that <color=#66FFCC>Bear Trap</color>.
M_Q_04_01_ResearchDone_David_03,"Go back to the <color=#FFA500>Item Production</color> menu, and select the <color=#FFA500>Craft</color> icon to start the process. Once it's done, the new item will be placed in your storage."

#,"아이템 작업 퀘스트 완료"
#,Player talks to David after completing production tutorial.
M_Q_04_01_GetCraftItem_Player_01,"I think I got it. This was a big help, David. "
M_Q_04_01_GetCraftItem_David_02,"Good. And it'll only become more intuitive the more you use it. And remember, if you're unsure how to do just about anything, the <color=#FFA500>Guide</color> is your friend."

#,Says goodbye and points player to Mr. Lao
M_Q_04_01_GuideLao_David_01,"So, yeah, that was a lot, and I hope it all made sense, but it's getting close to quitting time now. If you don't have a place to stay, <color=#FFFF00>speak with Mr. Lao</color>. I think a room just opened up after the last expedition underground, so tell him you want that bed. "
M_Q_04_01_GuideLao_Nar_02,(Just thinking of a nice warm bed causes your body to reflexively yawn. Which makes David yawn as well.)
M_Q_04_01_GuideLao_David_03,"Good luck, Maverick! Be sure to come back from time to time, and we can swap camp stories."
