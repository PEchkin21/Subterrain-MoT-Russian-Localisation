#,KeyPrefix: Act01_MQ_06

#,(Player asks Alp for a job)
#,(Job is to collect some mushrooms in the cave. Cave is at northeast of the hub structure.)
#,"(Alp also hints that he wants some meat too, but not easy to get.)"
#,(Alp gives a tool to help collecting mushroom)
Act01_MQ_06_Player_01,"Hey Alp, can I ask you something?"
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_02,Of course! Let's talk in my office. 

#,"(Player, Alp, and Ulf gather at the Pub. Alp and Player sit at bar, while Ulf is behind it.)"
Act01_MQ_06_Nar_03,"(Alp leads you back to the pub - his office. The two of you sit at the bar, and the bartender, Ulf, is currently wiping it down.)"
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_04,"So, back so soon? You just couldn't stay away from my food, eh?"
Act01_MQ_06_Player_05,"It was delicious, but I'm mostly looking for a job. Do you need help around here?"
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_06,"Oh, I am sorry. If we were a bigger pub, I could hire you, but I already have Miriam serving and Ulf acting as our official mascot. "
Act01_MQ_06_Nar_07,(Ulf lets out a giant fake laugh as he approaches.)
Act01_MQ_06_Ulf_08,"Go ahead and yuck it up, Alp, but you could never replace me. Maybe I'll give up bartending and have you back to mixing drinks with names you can't even remember, huh?"
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_09,"You know I kid, Ulf. Sheesh. So sensitive."
Act01_MQ_06_Nar_10,"(Alp gives Ulf a smile and a wink, and the hardened bartender does the same. They are friends, after all. He then returns his attention to you.)"
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_11,So you see? I have no work for you here.
Act01_MQ_06_Player_12,What about some work involving mushrooms?
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_13,"Oh, thank you for reminding me! Yes, some people ventured into the cave northeast of camp, and they brought me a few delicious mushrooms, but I need a lot more. With the right combination of these mushrooms and my private stash of peppers from Earth, this could be the key to bringing my family's Mantar sote to Titan."
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_14,"The more we can forage for around here helps save on supplies, so this could be a turning point for us. Mushrooms make a great meat substitute, which we need since we lost connection with HQ."
Act01_MQ_06_Player_15,"It's been a while since I've even seen a mushroom, let alone eaten one. "
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_16,"I'm sure you won't be disappointed, my friend! Take this to help dig up the <color=#66FFCC>mushrooms</color> and come back with as many as you can carry. At least 10, though."
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_16_01,"Also, the cave is really dark so you don't want to go in there without a light. Here, I will let you have my old lamp. It doesn't have much power left, but if you need more I'm sure you are resourceful enough fella to make request to be crafted more for you or purchase them from the camp's shop. I think Judith also sells them."
Act01_MQ_06_Nar_17,(You received <color=#66FFCC>Sickle</color> and <color=#66FFCC>Lamp</color>.)
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_18,Have fun mushroom hunting!

#,(Player brings back mushrooms)
#,(Player receives some rewards)
#,(Alp also hints to go and see Litzi by the generator for further job)
Act01_MQ_06_Player_19,"Hey, Alp. I got those mushrooms you wanted."
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_20,Great! I've been salivating just thinking of them since you left. I hope it wasn't too dangerous.
Act01_MQ_06_Nar_21,"(Like before, Alp looks you over to ensure no lasting injuries.)"
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_22,"Nope, you're in good shape. And soon, these mushrooms will make everyone else healthier too. Here's your payment, as promised. And a little bonus! Come back later so you can taste the new dish."
Act01_MQ_06_Nar_23,(You receive <color=#66FFCC>food</color> and <color=#66FFCC>drink</color>.)
Act01_MQ_06_Player_24,Do you have any other jobs I can handle? Mr. Lao will be breathing down my neck as soon as I get back to my room.
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_25,"Mr. Lao is a tough nut to crack, I agree. You solved my problem, but come to think of it, <color=#FFFF00>I remember Litzi mentioning she was short-handed at the Generator</color>. "
Act01_MQ_06_Player_26,Generator?
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_27,"Yup! Powers the whole camp, so keeping it running is crucial. It's the <color=#FFFF00>building with chimneys to the northwest</color>. You can't miss it, but if you get lost, check your <color=#FFA500>Omniscope</color>."
Act01_MQ_06_Alp_28,I'm going to get started on the mushrooms. See you soon!
