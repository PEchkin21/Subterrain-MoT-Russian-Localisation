#,"Fade in to Player and Ida walking down the hallway, meeting each other in the middle. "
Act03_MQ_42_Ida_01,Ah! I'm so happy I ran into you before boarding. 
Act03_MQ_42_Player_02,No problem. I'm used to people asking for favors around here by now. *haha* Did you need help packing?
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_03,(Ida shakes her head and grabs your hand.)
Act03_MQ_42_Ida_04,"No, no, no... I just wanted to tell you how thankful I am. You, {PlayerFullName}, have changed everyone's life here on Titan. "
Act03_MQ_42_Player_05,"It's me who should thank YOU, Ida. Without you, I wouldn't even be here. You were the first face I saw when I woke up, and you've had my back every step of the way. That has meant the world. "
Act03_MQ_42_Ida_06,"You're welcome, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. "
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_07,(Ida lets go of your hand and pulls out her datapad.)
Act03_MQ_42_Ida_08,I will see if there's room for your stasis pod on the airship. Connecting it to HQ's systems might give us a better chance of finally logging its data. 
Act03_MQ_42_Ida_09,I also can't wait to shove all the medical accomplishments I've made here on Titan in my sister Meera's face. Developing a vaccine for kidney disease is nothing compared to what we've done here... and this is just the beginning. 
Act03_MQ_42_Player_10,"Take your lap, but make it a fast one. *haha*"
Act03_MQ_42_Player_11,Now get to the airship. I'll see you there. 

#,"Fade in to outside the airship. In attendance: Litzi, David, Ida, Judith, Mr. Lao, Earl, Seoyeon, Alexei, Alp, Claudia."
#,"If player has completed side quest, then Tau is in jail and not on ship. If not, Tau has already boarded. "
#,All other NPC is supposed to be already boarded the ship.
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_12,"(There is a hopeful yet melancholy air to this, the final camp assembly. Everyone in attendance gathers, and the meeting begins.)"
Act03_MQ_42_Lao_13,"Let Mr. Lao be the first to say, on behalf of the entire camp, thank you for all your hard work, {PlayerFullName}."
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_14,"(Ida almost interrupts to point out she already thanked you, but keeps it to herself. No need to spoil the moment.)"
Act03_MQ_42_Player_15,"Of course! Thank you, Mr. Lao, and you're welcome, everyone. You all made me feel like I was part of the team, and it really was a team effort. "
Act03_MQ_42_Player_16,"Judith, your engineering know-how is remarkable! And you helped a lot with keeping the mine running, Alexei."
Act03_MQ_42_Judith_17,Tell me about it! I had to flex my inventive muscles hard to get us to this point. 
Act03_MQ_42_Alexei_18,"Hell yeah, Wolf. Anything for you. "
Act03_MQ_42_Player_19,"Ida, your thirst for knowledge and the nanobot modifications you made were really impressive. "
Act03_MQ_42_Ida_20,"My pleasure, but I couldn't have done it without Isko. I'll pass your message along to him. "
Act03_MQ_42_Alp_21,"Isko is the best, yeah."
Act03_MQ_42_Player_22,"There's also no way we would have the fuel to get to HQ without you, Litzi. "
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_23,"(Litzi, not used to being the center of attention, simply smiles and waves to the group in recognition.)"
Act03_MQ_42_Player_24,"Not to mention Alp for all the great tastes, Earl for keeping everyone hydrated, David for keeping tabs on supplies, Seoyeon for growing what we needed, and Claudia for ensuring our safety. It truly does take every cog for the machine to work."
Act03_MQ_42_Earl_25,I knew the spirits would answer my prayers. 
Act03_MQ_42_Seoyeon_26,And I was happy to help in my small way as well. Thank you. 
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_27,"(Everyone looks at each other, patting each other on the backs and hugging... except Claudia, who acknowledges the achievement but isn't into hugging.)"
Act03_MQ_42_David_28,I was also in charge of ensuring the airship was loaded up... and it is! So I suggest we move this group hug on board and start the engines. 
Act03_MQ_42_Claudia_29,"Yes, please. I don't want to spend another minute here. "
Act03_MQ_42_Player_30,"Listen, everyone: We're in this together. Whatever we do, we do as a group. Our survival depends on it, so let's give it our all!"
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_31,(Everyone says their goodbyes to Camp Huygen and boards the airship.)
Act03_MQ_42_Cyrus_32,All aboard who's coming aboard!

#,Fade out and fade in with everyone inside
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_33,"(Cyrus activates the terminal, and it's exhilaration. The entire airship suddenly rumbles with the energy of engines that haven't been used in months, even knocking a few people off their feet.)"
Act03_MQ_42_Nar_34,"(He pulls some levers and presses buttons frantically. After a few moments, the ship is stable and in the air. Your journey to TECC HQ is underway.)"
