#,Main Quest Name: Escape to Train
#,Purpose: Train-related events. 
#,Actor: Litzi Vogl
#,KeyPrefix: Act03_MQ_31

#,"Player finds the train for the first time. Curious at first, wonders if it was used to transfer supplies between camp and headquarters"
Act03_MQ_31_Player_01,"Wow, here it is! Now that's a big train! I've only ever seen pictures, but in person, these things are true wonders."
Act03_MQ_31_AI_02,I have already accessed the schematics for this <color=#FFFF00>Supply Train</color> make and model. Initiating scan. 
Act03_MQ_31_Player_03,"Good thinking. I bet this train was used to haul resources mined here back to TECC HQ. Nothing looks terribly damaged, but it's been unattended for a while. Will it work, Cassini?"
Act03_MQ_31_AI_04,"This part of the train should be operable, but as you said, this is a big train. More exploration is necessary to find the malfunction. "
Act03_MQ_31_Player_05,Heading in now. 

#,Player finds empty fuel canisters on the train. (Player needs to research this item in order to make more to power up the train.)
#,Litzi is responsible for researching the empty canister.
#,"Player communicates with Litzi, and she askes player to bring it back for a research."
Act03_MQ_31_AI_06,"We found the problem, {PlayerFullName}. This fuel canister is both depleted and damaged."
Act03_MQ_31_Nar_07,(You receive <color=#66FFCC>Empty Fuel Canisters</color>.)
Act03_MQ_31_Player_08,"Okay. Open communication with Litzi, Cassini. "
Act03_MQ_31_AI_09,<color=#FFFF00>Initiatingâ€¦</color>
Act03_MQ_31_Litzi_10,"Hey, did you find something?"
Act03_MQ_31_Player_11,"Yes, the underground train on Level 7 with no power. There are some empty fuel canisters, though. Could you help with researching them?"
Act03_MQ_31_Litzi_12,"Bring them to camp, put in a <color=#FFA500>Research</color> request, and I'll take it from there."
Act03_MQ_31_Nar_13,(Communication ends.)
Act03_MQ_31_Player_14,This train could be the fastest route out of here. Let's get it running.

#,Triggers when empty canister has been researched.
#,Litzi discovers that the original fuel canister was used as a emergency backup power for the train so it was not powerful enough to send train all the way to the headquarters
#,"So she developed a new, more powerful version of the fuel canister which requires highly concentrated methane substance."
Act03_MQ_31_Litzi_15,"Hey, I looked into those canisters like you asked, and... well... do you want the good news or bad news first?"
Act03_MQ_31_Player_16,Oh no. Hit me with the bad news first.
Act03_MQ_31_Litzi_17,"The canisters you brought back were for emergency backup only, so they won't be enough to take you all the way to TECC HQ."
Act03_MQ_31_Player_18,And the good news?
Act03_MQ_31_Litzi_19,"I just uploaded a <color=#66FFCC>Blueprint</color> for an updated canister for you, which should work for the entire trip to HQ. No worries about breaking down along the way, but I can't guarantee there'll be enough fuel left over to get you back here. "
Act03_MQ_31_Player_20,At least it's a shot. I'll gather the materials to <color=#FFA500>Craft</color> it ASAP.
Act03_MQ_31_Player_21,"By the way, you had me going for a minute there. Heh."
Act03_MQ_31_Litzi_22,I knew I did. *haha* Now go get that train chugging. 
Act03_MQ_31_Nar_23,(Communication ends.)

#,Event triggered when player meets mutated train warden.
#,Should describe it to be reconizable as train warden. Killing warden will drop a keycard to open the train barricade.
Act03_MQ_31_Player_24,"Well, aren't you an ugly one? Cassini?"
Act03_MQ_31_AI_25,Cross-referencing this creature with TECC personnel data and... this is the previous train warden.
Act03_MQ_31_Player_26,And he has a keycard embedded in his flesh.
Act03_MQ_31_AI_27,"Let's take it down, {PlayerFullName}."
Act03_MQ_31_Player_28,"Well said, Cassini."

#,After killing warden and obtaining the keycard
Act03_MQ_31_Nar_29,(Obtained <color=#66FFCC>Keycard: Warden</color>.)
