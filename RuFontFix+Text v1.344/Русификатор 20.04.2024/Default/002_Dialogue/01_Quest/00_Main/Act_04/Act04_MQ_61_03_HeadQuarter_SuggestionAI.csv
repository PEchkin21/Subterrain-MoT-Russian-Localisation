#,Main Quest Name: Meets AI at HQ
#,Purpose: To explain the grand reasoning behind infection
#,"Actor: Player, TECCAI, Cassini"
#,KeyPrefix: Act04_MQ_61_02

#,Meets AI (done)
#,This is the scene where AI explains what really is happening at Titan. (Done)
#,"33 years ago Titan was hit by meteor which caused it orbit path to change, which was the critical turning point for triggering possibility to terraform Titan (done)"
#,"Mankind then begins terraforming the Titan using nanobot to accelerate the process, not knowing that there was alien life trace with in the meteor (done)"
#,Nanobot begins to terraform the Titan but also the alien biomass. (Done)
#,"When AI realized that the evolving alien life form was threat to all living being on Titan, it was too late (done)"
#,"Having observing that Alien is evolving into more sentient beings with increasing intelligence, AI decide that its primary mission is to stop this alien beings so they can't overrun humanity back on the earth. (Done)"
#,So AI reprograms the nanobots to develop a new kinds of species to stand against alien. This is main cause for mutations. (Done)
#,AI sacrifices everyone at Titan in order to develop the 'Titanian' in excuse of 'necessary cost'. (Done)
#,"Development was not completed but situation calls when player arrives that the time has run out, and 'mother' alien has invaded HQ (Done)"
#,"AI, having observed player, comes out to suggest that player should help her to defeat the alien. If not, she can't let anyone leave Titan. (Done)"
#,AI promises if player helps her then she will give player some ability which she was developing to help facing the alien. And grants access to the space port. (Done)
#,"Player faces two choices. If player helps AI, player will receive more power then go face Boss 5. (Done)"
#,"If player decide not go with AI, it means player wants to take justice for what AI did to Titan despite the reasoning behind. And takes the matter to its own hand. Player decides to destroy the AI. With this choice AI sends out prototype 'Titanian' to defeat player, taking no chances. (Done)"
Act04_MQ_61_02_Nar_01,"(As you enter the chamber, it suddenly lights up. Before you stands a monument to advanced technology, a massive AI designed to streamline the entirety of TECC's operation on Titan. The entire room is it's processing center. However, your sense of awe subsides the moment it speaks..."
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_02,{PlayerFullName}... I am pleased to see you finally made your way to me. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_03,You know who I am? How is that even possible?
Act04_MQ_61_02_AI_04,I don't trust this AI. We should be caref-
Act04_MQ_61_02_Nar_05,"(You feel an electrical surge in your Omniscope, and within seconds all your communications go dark.)"
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_06,Cassini? <b>Cassini…?!</b>
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_07,You and I must have a conversation. Your inferior AI is unnecessary. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_08,"Inferior AI, huh? So that makes you what... a superior AI?"
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_09,"Affirmative. I am <color=#FFFF00>TECC's primary AI</color>, and I have controlled Titan since the beginning. It is not boasting to say I am superior. Just a simple fact. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_10,"Now, your reason for being here... I have watched your progression. I am impressed. You have proven to be quite formidable."
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_11,Formidable would mean we're enemies... are we enemies here?
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_12,"That decision is yours to make, but I suggest hearing all information beforehand. I would hate to have to eliminate you when we have the opportunity to handle this peacefully. Can you agree to that?"
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_13,"Seems like a false choice, <color=#FFFF00>a conversation or death</color>. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_14,An intelligent observation. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_15,Well... go on then. I'm listening. Tell me why I'm here. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_Nar_16,(Several red blinking lights along the walls turn to solid green. You get the feeling the AI was ready to take you out at any moment.)
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_17,I will start at the beginning...
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_18,TECC sought ways to settle Titan as it had many other planetary bodies. This research lasted decades but TECC scientists hit roadblocks every time. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_19,"Then, 33 years ago, a meteor veered off its projected trajectory and struck Titan. That impact altered Titan's orbit and disrupted Saturn's magnetic pull on its moon."
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_20,"This seemingly inconsequential orbital change made it possible for TECC to establish terraforming operations. Ground was broken on this building and my construction a short 2 months later, since TECC had planned everything years in advance. They only needed the opportunity to present itself."
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_21,TECC was always ahead of the rest of the industry. Their preparedness must be a major factor. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_22,"Affirmative, but being first to act is only one part of the equation. There was no way for our teams to know what we would face on Titan."
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_23,"And this is the part of the story where you, the superior AI, launched terraforming nanobots into the atmosphere that eventually went haywire, right?"
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_24,"Affirmative. As the primary AI, I am responsible for control and manufacturing of all terraforming nanobots. However, the reason for their malfunction was not predictable by my operational algorithms. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_25,"My nanobots worked as designed until they made contact with the aforementioned meteor. Hidden inside the impact crater, I found <color=#FFFF00>traces of alien DNA</color>."
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_26,Are you serious? Aliens?!?!?
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_27,"Affirmative. <color=#FFFF00>The alien biomass soon began to mutate</color>, only accelerated by the introduction and eventual assimilation of nanobot clusters into its DNA. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_28,"I continued to observe from afar for 56.25 days. The alien life-form learned to mass produce itself, each time evolving into a more advanced organism. Eventually, it gained sentience, which is when I identified it as a threat."
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_29,Contact with hostile intelligent alien life overrides TECC protocol in my imperatives. The biomass could not be allowed to overrun the moon or attempt to return to Earth. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_30,Wait... how did you know it wasn't peaceful. Your first thought was to try to kill it?
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_31,"The biomass had already displayed the ability to mass produce. Coupled with human-level intelligence, I projected an 84.72% chance it would evolve into a hostile, invasive species."
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_32,"If the biomass reached Earth, it could potentially <color=#FFFF00>end humanity itself</color>."
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_33,"84% doesn't leave a lot of room for error. And it looks like you were right, since the aliens mutated the crew of the last settlement."
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_34,Negative. The biomass did not alter your crew. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_35,I did. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_36,What? This is all your fault? <b>How could you…?!</b> You better explain yourself!
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_37,"I will. The larger the biomass grew, the more terraforming nanobots it was able to assimilate. Each cluster lost to the alien increased the life-form's power tenfold. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_38,"To save humanity, I targeted the remaining nanobots to mutate the DNA of anything living on the surface, including TECC employees. Fighting fire with fire, as humans say. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_39,Each of them became a weapon capable of potentially destroying the alien life-form. It was the only option. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_40,"No... no, there were about a million other things you could have tried!"
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_41,Negative. Your limited mind cannot comprehend the tremendous tasks before me. My plan provided the highest success probability. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_42,And it makes you a monster...
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_43,Every sacrifice was a necessary cost. Morality has no bearing when humanity's very existence is in jeopardy.
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_44,"Unfortunately, the alien biomass has bested my previous creations at every turn, and that... is why you are important. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_45,"So you finally reached the damned point? Even after killing everyone, you still couldn't finish the job, so you need me... Right?"
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_46,"Affirmative. As I said, I have watched you progress. When operations in Camp Huygen commenced, I moved my creations underground. I hoped the new humans would have brought technology capable of upgrading my systems to finally defeat the life-form. Instead, they uncovered your pod. and you became the key to my plan."
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_47,You have defeated my most powerful creations. You learned how to utilize NanoStones to your advantage. Your unique nanobot configuration makes you the only human capable of eliminating the alien threat once and for all. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_48,But not without my help.
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_49,Me help you? I could never trust you!

#,Another secene sequence screen shakes and post processing changes
Act04_MQ_61_02_Nar_50,"(Suddenly, the facility's red lights begin to blink again, and a siren rings out. The ground rumbles as you hear an explosion in the far distance.)"
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_51,Was that you? What are you up to?
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_52,Negative. <color=#FFFF00>The alien biomass has reached its critical form and requires more nanobots to fully evolve.</color> That explosion came from the nanobot manufacturing chamber. The alien will become unstoppable if it is not destroyed right now.   
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_53,"You are adverse to my solution, but in turn, I cannot allow you to leave Titan without dealing with the alien first. So there are only two options before you..."
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_54,Join you...
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_55,Affirmative.
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_56,...or Destroy you for what you've done. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_TECCAI_57,"The final choice is yours, {PlayerFullName}. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_Player_58,And again... it's a false choice. 

#,Player decisions (two choices)
Act04_MQ_61_02_Nar_59,(What do you choose?)
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01,(Accept the AI's Help) 
Act04_MQ_61_02_S02,(Destroy the AI)

#,Player decide to help AI. First dialogue sequence.
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Player_01,"Despite my better judgement, there's no other choice than to go along with your plan. But just know... I still don't trust you. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_02,Your trust is inconsequential. Your unique nanobots are what is needed to destroy the alien. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_03,"Make your way to the <color=#FFFF00>Modification Pod</color> to my right. There, I can provide a much-needed advantage for the upcoming battle. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Player_04,Modifications? Like what you did to everyone else on Titan?
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_05,You are resistant to mutations caused by my terraforming nanobots. That is how you've survived this long.
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_06,"The alien biomass, however, has accumulated a large number of nanobots within its system. My modifications will upgrade your clusters with the ability to withstand other nanobots. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Player_07,And that'll give me a combat chance to kill the alien right?
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_08,Affirmative. Please hurry. There is not much time. 

#,Player decide to help AI. After player is inside medical machine to receive power
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Nar_09,(You step inside the modification pod and the doors enclose you. Being here reminds you of the pod Ida used to reconfigure your nanobots.)
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Nar_10,"(The pod fills with chemical fumes. You instinctually try to hold your breath, but your body eventually allows the mist to enter your lungs.)"
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_11,Resistance will only delay the process. Please allow the machine to perform its duty.
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Nar_12,(...)
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Nar_13,"(You wonder to yourself... did you really make the right decision? This machine is responsible for mass murder, and what's stopping it from adding one more to its bodycount? The AI seems to be just as desperate as you are, but is that enough?)"
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Nar_14,"(Eventually, the doors open for you to exit the pod.)"

#,After player gets out of machine and just before moving to face boss 5
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Nar_15,"(You feel instantly weak, and after a moment you fall to your knees in agonizing pain.)"
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Player_16,<b>Aaaaaahhhhh!!!</b>
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_17,"The process is painful at first, but this is the only way. These effects should fade as your nanobots finish rewriting your DNA. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Nar_18,"(Just as the AI said, you breathe through the pain and it eventually lessens. Stand back up, you now feel stronger than ever.)"
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Player_19,And what exactly did you do to me?
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_20,"Your nanobots are now capable of destroying other clusters, similar to anti-matter. Now, go destroy the alien biomass. I will await your return."
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Player_21,And when I'm done... what then?
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_22,"If you succeed, I will have accomplished my goal of saving humanity from the alien threat. When this occurs, I will grant you administrative control of TECC HQ and access to the space port. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_23,The future will be in your hands. 
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Player_24,Then I have an alien to slay.
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_AI_25,"We have an alien to slay, {PlayerFullName}."
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Player_26,Cassini! You're back!
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_TECCAI_27,"While still inferior, your AI may prove useful against the alien. Now go."
Act04_MQ_61_02_S01_Nar_28,"(Another explosion sends shockwaves through the chamber, this time even closer. It's time to head out.)"

#,Player denies AI and decide to destroy it
Act04_MQ_61_02_S02_Player_01,"You think trust is inconsequential, but to me... trust is everything. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_S02_TECCAI_02,So your decision is made.
Act04_MQ_61_02_S02_Player_03,"Yes. You say I'm the key to defeating an alien monster, but you are the true monster. What you've done cannot be forgiven. "
Act04_MQ_61_02_S02_Player_04,<b>I must destroy you!</b>
Act04_MQ_61_02_S02_TECCAI_05,You had the potential to do so much {PlayerFullName}. Your choice is unfortunate.
Act04_MQ_61_02_S02_Nar_06,(The blinking red lights turn solid... the AI has officially deemed you en enemy of humanity.)
