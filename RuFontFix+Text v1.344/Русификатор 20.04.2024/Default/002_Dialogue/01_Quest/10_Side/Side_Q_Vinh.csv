#,Quest Name: To Be the Best 
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_ToBeTheBest

#,Player is challenged to get to their strongest personal ability by Vinh so they can be good enough to battler her
#,Player will receive XP 

#,Player receives a message from Vinh
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_AI_01,"Incoming message from Vinh, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_02,I have heard from others that you are a capable fighter. Come to security... I'd like to see for myself.\n-Vinh Pham-

#,"When player enters Security, fade out"
#,Fade in to a gym/dojo. Vinh is hitting a punching bag when the player enters. 
#,"Once scene ends, player is put back outside of security. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Nar_03,"(As you enter the dojo, Vinh is thrashing the punching bag, each punch like an explosion. She is obviously strong... which makes her a great security guard.)"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_04,"Hi, Vinh... I came as soon as I could. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_05,"You are not. In fact, it is good to be in the presence of a fellow warrior. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Nar_06,(Vinh lands a final punch. It is so powerful that the chain holding the punching bag breaks and the punching bag flies against the wall.)
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_07,Wow! I've never been happier to not be a punching bag. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_08,"Humor is good, but it often masks fear. Are you scared?"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_09,"Of you? Well, maybe a little. You're a bit intense, Vinh, you look like you want to fight me or something. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_10,I do.
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_11,"Wait, what? You do?"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_12,"Yes, but not today. It wouldn't be a challenge at all if we fought right now. You must focus on getting stronger. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_13,But why do you want to fight me?
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_14,"I come from a family of warriors, and need to keep my skills honed. I have already battled everyone in Camp Huygen. A few submitted to me in seconds. Others were actually a challenge, which I enjoyed."
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_15,"To date, I've only lost twice. Once to Claudia, who proved why she is the leader of the security team."
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_16,"My only other loss was to Tau, who is a dirty fighter. He won, but I am constantly training to face him again. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_17,"And I'm part of that training for you, right?"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_18,"In a way... but you and I exist to push each other to be our best. I'm going to sync to your Omniscope's biomarkers. Once you are strong enough, I will send you an official challenge. It is up to you to accept or submit from there. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_19,Sounds fair. I will keep training and getting better. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_20,And I will be waiting.

#,When player reaches at least 40 in all Attributes
#,Vinh sends the player credits and some craft materials
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_AI_21,"Incoming message from Vinh, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_22,I can see your training is paying off. Keep pushing yourself.\n-Vinh Pham-

#,When player reaches at least 60 in all Attributes
#,Vinh sends the player credits and some craft materials
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_AI_23,"Incoming message from Vinh, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_24,You have improved considerably. Just a little more before we can battle.\n-Vinh Pham-

#,When player reaches at least 80 in all Attributes
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_AI_25,"Incoming message from Vinh, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_26,"This is your official challenge to fight me. If you accept, come to Security for our fight.\n-Vinh Pham-"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_AI_27,"If Vinh is as tough as she claims, please ensure you are ready before facing her. "

#,"When player re-enters Security, fade out"
#,Fade in to a gym/dojo. Vinh is hitting a punching bag when the player enters. 
#,"Once scene ends, player is put back outside of security. "
#,"Battle is without any weapons or gear, and should be difficult but not un-winnable. Win or lose, the player is rewarded. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_28,"So...do you accept my challenge, {PlayerFullName}?"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_29,"I do, Vinh. I can't wait to see how strong you really are. "
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_30,Then let us begin!
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Nar_30,"(Your epic fight with Vinh requires both strategy and luck.\n\nEach round, you get to choose one of the following actions:n\Attack: Strike at Vinh to deal damage (Beats Rest)n\Counter: Defend and counterattack (Beats Attack)n\Rest: Hold action to Recover HP (Beats Counter)n\n\Vinh is an expert warrior and difficult to read in battle. She'll give no hints about her next move, so let's hope luck is on your side.)"

#,"If player wins the fight, they get new gear, credits, and craft materials"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Nar_31,"(The battle ends with your knuckles connecting with Vinh's stomach. Both of you are exhausted and breathing heavily, a sign of just how hard you pushed each other.)"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_32,I guess... I have... three names on my list... of defeats.
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_33,You certainly didn't... make it easy... You are a fan... tastic fighter.
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_34,But not... fantastic enough... it seems. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_35,I'm sure it... was just beginner's... luck. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_36,Don't do that... you have to own your win... You earned it. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_37,You also earned... this. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Nar_38,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Soldier's Headband</color>'.)"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_39,It is fit only... for a true warrior. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_40,Thank you... I'll wear it with... pride. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_41,Good... now get out of here... I need to recover before... my next shift.
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_42,"Same... see you later, Vinh."

#,"If player loses the fight, they get new gear and credits"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Nar_43,"(The battle ends with Vinh's knee connecting with the back of your head. You collapse to the ground in exhaustion, and Vinh follows shortly after her win is confirmed. Both of you are almost out of breath from the intense fight.)"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_44,"That was... an incredible... fight, Vinh. That's one... more W for you."
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_45,You pushed me... to my limits {PlayerFullName}... you've grown so much.
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_46,I guess... I haven't grown... enough.
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_47,Don't do that... you have to... own your progress... even in... the face of defeat.
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_48,Also... you earned... this. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Nar_49,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Soldier's Headband</color>'.)"
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_50,It is fit only... for a true warrior. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_51,Thank you... I'll wear it with... pride. 
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Vinh_52,Good... now get out of here... I need to recover before... my next shift.
Side_Q_ToBeTheBest_Player_53,"Same... see you later, Vinh."
