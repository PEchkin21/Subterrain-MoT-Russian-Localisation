#,Document Outline: Side Quest Dialogue Text

#,Quest NPC: Jozef Pertragolavic
#,Quest Name: Game Night 
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_GameNight

#,"He asks the player to invite Isko, Katerina, Temir, and Octavio to a poker night. Receives XP for each person that says yes. "
#,"Characters in attendance that don't need to be invited are Cyrus, Idrissi, Cristhyan, and Jozef."
#,"Note: If player touches Jozef's car in the garage, they cannot take this quest."

#,"Jozef's miniature car replica is sitting at his workstation in the garage/hanger from the beginning of the game. This is tempting for the player to touch, but they shouldn't because he hates that. And he tells the player that in his Basic_Jozef dialogue."
#,"If the player interacts with it, they get the following choice. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Nar_01,"(This is Jozef's prized possession. A real-to-life miniature replica of a vintage 2023 MoTex Scorpion that, if one were tiny enough, could actually be driven. It even has a J02EF vanity plate. It's truly a sight to behold, and something calls you to touch it, even though you know you shouldn't.)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Touch_S01,Don't touch it.
Side_Q_GameNight_Touch_S02,Touch it.

#,"If player chooses not to touch it, nothing happens. They can just go on with their life, and this quest will happen normally. "
#,"If player DOES touch it, however, they do not get this mission. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Touch_S02_Nar_01,"(Despite what your head tells you, your heart wants to touch the car replica. It is smooth and shiny, and the articulating doors and trunk are a sight to behold. You feel satisfied with the experience.)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Touch_S02_Nar_02,"(You have already touched the car. Your desire to touch the car again overwhelms you, but you realized that you shouldn't so decided to leave it.)"

#,"If player touches Jozef's car, this replaces Basic_Jozef."
Side_Q_GameNight_Touch_S02_Jozef_02,"I know you touched my car, and that disgusts me. Don't talk to me. "

#,Player receives message to start quest
Side_Q_GameNight_AI_02,"Incoming message from Jozef, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_03,"I'm throwing a game night, and you're invited if you can help me out. I'll explain more next time we speak.\n-Jozef Pertragolavic-"

#,When player speaks to Jozef
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_04_01,"Hi, Jozef! Game night sounds exciting!"
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_04,"Hi, Jozef! Game night sounds exciting! What do you need me to do to clinch my invite?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_05,Nothing too difficult. I see you making connections with everyone around camp.
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_06,"I run a game night now and then. We get together and play cards, bullshit, and throw credits around. We have a full table, but I want to mix things up with some new players. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_07,"So, I need to try to get people to come to the game night?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_08,"Yeah. Three would be perfect, but we could probably work with two if you're not as popular as I believe you are. Invite more if you want, though. It's a party."
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_09,"I invited Katerina, but haven't heard back. That's a place to start. She's a good person."
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_10,Okay... I'm off to give in-person invites. 

#,When player speaks to Jozef after starting quest
#,Replaces Basic_Jozef until end of quest
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_11,You invite enough people to game night?

#,———————————————————————
#,If player speaks to Katerina without finishing Bringing Justice (Dalton's quest)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_12_01,"Hey, Katerina! Jozef said he sent you an invite to game night."
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_12,"Hey, Katerina! Jozef said he sent you an invite to game night. Did you get it?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_13,Yup.
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_14,Oh... were you going to go?
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_15,Hmmm... don't know. Who else is going to be there?

#,Player dialogue choice with Katerina
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S01,Who cares as long as you're there.
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02,Lots of people!

#,"Player picks S01, (success)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S01_Katerina_01,"I don't need the brown-nosing. I like playing cards, but I hate RSVPs. I was going to show up anyway."
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S01_Player_02,"You're always on brand, Katerina. I guess I'll see you there. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S01_Katerina_03,Mmhmm. 

#,"Player picks S02, (failure, but player gets second chance)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_Katerina_01,"Have you known me to be a people person, {PlayerFullName}?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_Player_02,"Um... Not really, no. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_Katerina_03,*sigh* How many people are we talking?

#,Player choice after S02
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_1,Just enough to play cards. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_2,"A dozen or so, maybe... "

#,Player picks S02-1 (success)
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_1_Katerina_01,You can tell Jozef I'll be there then.
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_1_Player_02,Great! I'll see you there!
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_1_Katerina_03,Mmhmm. 

#,Player picks S02-2 (failure)
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_2_Nar_01,(Katerina looks unimpressed at your answer.)
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_2_Katerina_02,I'll pass. I'm not into big parties. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_2_Player_03,"Oh, okay. Anything I can do to change your mind?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_S02_2_Katerina_04,Nope. I'll see you later.

#,If player speaks to Katerina after finishing Bringing Justice and Tau is in jail. Katerina doesn't need convincing. Auto-success. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_16,"Hey, Katerina! Jozef said he invited you to his game night. Did you get the invite?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_17,Yup. I'm just not into the whole RSVP system of expectations. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_18,"But you are coming, right?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_19,"Yes. I've been in a better mood since Tau was put away. He stole from me and deserves to rot, so game night is dedicated to his arrest as far as I'm concerned."
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_20,*haha* Agreed. I'll see you there! 

#,———————————————————————
#,Player speaks with Isko (no auto success/failure with him)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_21,"Hey, Isko! Do you want to come to Jozef's game night?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_22,"I love games, and bets are totally my thing. Did I ever tell you that I'm on Titan because I bet my childhood friends I could get farther away from our hometown than they could? Look at me now! *haha* I won!"
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_23,"But... Jozef has invited me to a game night before and I didn't really click with anyone there. So I may have to decline. "

#,Player dialogue choice with Isko
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S01,"Hey, I'll be there and I'll make sure you have fun."
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02,Maybe you could get to know Jozef better...

#,"Player picks S01, (success)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S01_Isko_01,"Yeah? Well, if you put it that way, count me in. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S01_Player_02,Okay! I'll send you the details and see you there. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S01_Isko_03,See you there!

#,"Player picks S02, (failure, but player gets second chance)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_Isko_01,"I don't know... Jozef is my exact opposite. Plus I have a bunch of work to catch up on, so I probably just shouldn't. "

#,Player choice after S02
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_1_01,You're always covering for Ida.
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_2_01,It's just one night.
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_1,"You're always covering for Ida. Give her some of the work, so you can come hang. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_2,"It's just one night. Can you make an exception for ONE night off, right? Come on!"

#,Player picks S02-1 (failure)
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_1_Isko_01,"Hey... Ida is busy too. And if it wasn't for her, you'd still be in a pod. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_1_Player_02,"True, but she could help you out a little more now. I'm out of the pod. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_1_Isko_03,"We're still making new breakthroughs every day. I'm going to stay in and work, but thanks for the invite. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_1_Player_04,"Understood, Isko. I meant no offense to Ida. I guess I'll see you later. "

#,Player picks S02-2 (success)
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_2_Isko_01,"Okay, okay, you twisted my arm. I can take one night off, but only one. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_2_Player_02,Awesome! I'll make sure you have fun. Don't worry. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_S02_2_Isko_03,"When you're involved, I'm never worried. See you there. "

#,———————————————————————
#,Player speaks with Temir but has not completed Sinking Feeling
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_24_01,Jozef's game night
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_24,"Hey, Temir! Do you want to take a break from thermodynamics to join me at Jozef's game night?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_25,"Oh... um... I'm not normally invited to parties. I don't know how I feel about it, and always come off socially awkward at large gatherings. "

#,Player dialogue choice with Temir
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01,"We all have our awkward moments, but you'll be fine."
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S02,"Camp isn't that big, so at least you'll know everyone at the party. "

#,"Player picks S02, (success)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_Temir_01,That's a good point. No one's really 'new' anymore about here. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_Player_02,Exactly! You'll just be the same awkward we all know you for already. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_Temir_03,Fair enough. Count me in.
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_Player_04,Awesome! I'll send you the details and see you later. 

#,"Player picks S01, (failure, but player gets second chance)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_Temir_01,"Your version of awkward and mine don't compare, trust me. I'm levels above you. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_Temir_02,I'm actually already getting nervous just thinking about it. 

#,Player choice after S01
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_1,"No pressure. The invite is open, so just show up if you can."
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_2,"Come on, Temir. You have to be there!"

#,Player picks S01-1 (success)
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_1_Temir_01,Thank you for not pressuring me. I'll be there once I calm down. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_1_Player_02,"It's okay if you duck out early too, but I know game night will be more fun with you there. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_1_Temir_03,I appreciate that. See you later. 

#,Player picks S01-2 (failure)
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_2_Temir_01,"I don't know, I don't know. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_2_Nar_02,"(Temir's eyes dart back and forth, and he starts biting his nails.)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_2_Player_03,"You okay, Temir?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_2_Temir_04,No. I need to go somewhere and calm down. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_S01_2_Nar_05,(It doesn't look like Temir will be making it to the party.)

#,Is player completed Sinking Feeling by asking Litzi for the heat sink (auto success)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_26,"Hey, Temir! Do you want to take a break from thermodynamics to join me at Jozef's game night?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_27,"If you'll be there, then I guess I can go too. You helped me with some serious science, but now we can let loose together too. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_28,Awesome! I'll send you the details and see you later. 

#,Is player completed Sinking Feeling by stealing the heat sink (auto failure)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_29,"Hey, Temir! Do you want to take a break from thermodynamics to join me at Jozef's game night?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_30,"Oh, no thank you. Too much research to do. I have to figure out a new way to impress Litzi. See you later. "

#,———————————————————————
#,Player speaks with Martin (no auto success/failure with him)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_31_01,Do you want to come to Jozef's game night?
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_31,"Hey, Martin! I'm guessing you love a good card game. Do you want to come to Jozef's game night?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_32,"You guessed right, {PlayerFullName}! And when the drinks get flowing, I have tons of stories to share too!"

#,Player dialogue choice with Martin
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01,"Jozef is a serious guy, so you may want to stick to the short stories."
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S02,I don't know if there'll be drinks at this party. 

#,Player picks S02 (success)
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S02_Martin_01,"So, it's BYOB? Perfect! "

#,"Player picks S01 (failure, but player gets second chance)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01_Martin_01,"Hmmm... he can be a stick in the mud sometimes, but I never come empty-handed either. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01_Martin_02,What kind of gift should I bring to the event?

#,Player choice after S01
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01_1,What about a pair of pliers to remove his... stick? *haha*
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01_2,Jozef loves cigars if you have some to share.

#,Player chooses S01-1 (failure)
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01_1_Martin_01,"*haha* Good one! I have a feeling I'll be looking all night for the right gift, though. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01_1_Martin_02,"If I don't find something, then I won't attend. Maybe I'll see you there, but maybe not. We'll see. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01_1_Nar_03,(Martin's uncertainty probably means he's not coming.)

#,Player chooses S01-2 (success)
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_S01_2_Martin_01,That's a perfect idea! I'll grab a few stogies and see you at game night.

#,Player dialogue choice with Octavio
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S01,Whatever you like! I'm sure it'll be good!

#,"Player picks S01, (success)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S01_Octavio_01,Bet! I'll make the perfect mixtape for game night! 
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S01_Player_02,Hope there's enough time. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S01_Octavio_03,Plenty... I already have a bunch of ideas. Later!

#,"Player picks S02, (failure, but player gets second chance)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S02_Octavio_01,Most of my collection is electronica. I hope Jozef doesn't hate it and kick me out.

#,Player choice after S02
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S02_1,No way! He'll just have to lighten up.
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S02_2,It's a possibility...

#,Player picks S02-1 (success)
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S02_1_Octavio_01,"Bet! I'll try to tweak my mixtape for Jozef though, just in case. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S02_1_Octavio_02,You'll see me there. Later!

#,Player picks S02-2 (failure)
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_S02_2_Octavio_01,"Bad tunes equals a bad party, so I think I need to decline the invite."

Side_Q_GameNight_Player_41,Hey Octavio! You're a party guy... wanna come to Jozef's game night?
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_42,I think I'll skip it if you're going. I wouldn't be caught dead at some loser party. Bye. 

#,———————————————————————
#,"When the player has gotten at least 3 NPCs to say yes, they are prompted that they can invite more or go to Jozef."
Side_Q_GameNight_AI_47,You have invited the prerequisite number of people for Jozef's game night. We can return to him or invite others at your leisure. 

#,"When the player has asked everyone, they are prompted go to Jozef. "
Side_Q_GameNight_AI_48,You have invited all potential guests. We should return to Jozef and speak with him. 

#,"When the player has asked everyone, but failed to get enough players"
Side_Q_GameNight_AI_49,"We have contacted some potential guests, but unfortunately, I don't think we will have enough people to play. We should speak to Jozef regardless. "

#,———————————————————————
#,Player returns to Jozef but did NOT get enough invites
#,Player does not receive any credits or other rewards. Only the XP for the one or two Yes results they got.
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_49_01,Failed to get enough players.
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_49,"Hi, Jozef. I've asked everyone I thought might be interested in game night, but didn't get enough yeses. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_50,It's too bad. I was hoping to see how good you were at cards. Maybe you can make the next one. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_51,When's the next one?
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_52,Who knows? Maybe never. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Nar_53,"(Jozef takes a puff of his cigar and blows smoke in your face, which marks the end of this conversation.)"

#,Player returns to Jozef after getting enough invites
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_54,"Hi, Jozef. I've asked around, and lots of people said yes."

Side_Q_GameNight_StartGN_S02_Jozef_01,Everything's ready when you are. Just give the word. 

#,———————————————————————
#,"Game night itself takes place in the games room. Jozef has already invited Idrissi, Cyrus, and Cristhyan. Player is there with whoever said yes to their invites. "
#,"The mechanics of this scene has two components. The first consists of individual dialogue when you interact in between games, which is there to grant info on how good they are as players. Martin, for instance, seems like he'd be terrible, but also shares he was a spy, which should tell the player he'll be a tough opponent. "
#,"The second component of Game Night is choosing who you play against. Some NPCs are great at cards, while others are terrible. Each gets a numeric value from 1-5 (kept secret from player), and the trick is to guess who the player has the best chance of beating."
#,"There is a max of 9 possible opponents (not counting the potential of a GF option) if ALL NPCs accept invite. Player gets to play 3 games, choosing 3 opponents each time, and each opponent gets to play at least once. If fewer than 9 opponents are at the party"
#,Possible players and their rankings:
#,Jozef = 4
#,Idrissi = 5
#,Cyrus = 3
#,Cristhyan = 3
#,Isko = 3
#,Martin = 4
#,Temir = 1
#,Octavio = 2
#,Katerina = 2
#,Freyja (player or Octavio GF option) = 1
#,Nina (GF option) = 3
#,"If the total challenge rating is 11 or more, then player loses. If 10 or less, player wins. Credits won or lost is 100, plus another 100 credits for each point margin higher or lower than 10."
#,"Win example: if player chooses Idrissi (5), Temir (1), and Martin (2) (total 8 challenge), then it's an easy game. Player wins 300 credits (100 at 10, then +100 at 9 and +100 at 8)."
#,"Lose example: if the player chooses Jozef (4), Cyrus (4), and Isko (3) (total 11 challenge), then the game is just too tough. Player loses 200 credits (100 at 10, and then go up by another 100 at 11)."
#,Fade in on game room. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Nar_57,"(Game Night has finally arrived! All players are in attendance, and have taken their time to mingle and commence small talk. Then Jozef addresses the room.)"
Side_Q_GameNight_Jozef_58,"Everyone, listen! It's time to start the games! Since we have an even better turnout because of you, {PlayerFullName}, you have the honor of choosing your opponents."
Side_Q_GameNight_Cyrus_59,Pick carefully or you might walk away with empty pockets. *haha*

#,Player speaks to Cyrus in-between games (default NPC)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_61,"Good to see you, Cyrus. This is my first game night. Got any tips for me?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Cyrus_62,Tips? Be wary of Idrissi. That stoic attitude he carries outside game night is his secret weapon. He'll be a tough opponent regardless of who else is playing. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_63,I appreciate the heads up. 

#,When player speaks to Cyrus after initial interaction
Side_Q_GameNight_Cyrus_64,"I always look forward to game night, and tonight is the best one yet."

#,Player speaks to Cristhyan in-between games (default NPC)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_70,"Hi, Cristhyan. Are you a regular at game night?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Cristhyan_71,"Totally. I was the one who started all this as a way for us gearheads to socialize. I do the plumbing around camp. Add in Cyrus and Jozef from the garage and Idrissi from maintenance, and that leads to a lot of grease-stained cards. *haha* I have to buy a few new decks every game night. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_72,That's cool of you to bring people together. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Cristhyan_73,"I'm not even that good at cards, but I love to play. The guys usually clean me out, so I'm glad you brought in some new blood."
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_74,"Me too! And, hey, maybe you'll win some money tonight."
Side_Q_GameNight_Cristhyan_75,"From your lips to god's ears, {PlayerFullName}."

Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_78,"Drinks, friends, games, music... This is exactly what I needed. My mom always told me I was a workaholic. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_79,It's time to play as hard as you work. Bring that energy to the table. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_80,"I'm no stranger to cards, so watch out. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_81,Consider me warned. 

#,When player speaks to Isko after initial interaction
Side_Q_GameNight_Isko_82,I'm betting big tonight!

Side_Q_GameNight_Player_85,Do you play a lot of cards?
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_86,"The dance floor has a way of luring me away, but I'm not the worst. I'll try my best, though."
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_87,I can't wait!

#,When player speaks to Octavio after initial interaction
Side_Q_GameNight_Octavio_88,Turn the music up! It's time to dance before the next game!

#,Player speaks to Temir in-between games (Invited NPC)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_89,"Good to see you conquered your awkwardness tonight, Temir. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_90,"Yes. I need to loosen up, and game night is already helping. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_91,It'll be fun to play against you as well. 
Side_Q_GameNight_Temir_92,"I don't think I've played this game before, so take it easy on me. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_93,*haha* Maybe you'll have beginner's luck. 

#,When player speaks to Temir after initial interaction

#,Player speaks to Martin in-between games (Invited NPC)
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_95,"Hey, Martin! Having fun?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_96,"Of course, though I can have fun anywhere. I BRING the fun!"
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_97,Totally! Got any fun stories to share tonight?
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_98,"When do I not have a story to tell? I was just telling Idrissi about my time as a Chilean spy. Turns out we might have crossed paths when I was working in Tunisia. Small moon, right?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_99,Wait... You were actually able to have a conversation with Idrissi?
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_100,You just gotta speak his language... and I speak 9 of them. Easy peasy.
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_101,I'll let you get back to it then. Have fun!

#,When player speaks to Martin after initial interaction
Side_Q_GameNight_Martin_102,Did I ever tell you the time I...

Side_Q_GameNight_Player_103,"Hey, Katerina."
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_104,"Hello, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_105,Having fun?
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_106,Yup. Loads.
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_107,"Does your general attitude help you play cards better? It's hard to get a read on you sometimes, so I could see that extending to games too."
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_108,"*sigh* The opposite, actually. You think I'm complicated, but I'm really not. Most things annoy me, and I hate to lose. I have zero poker face. "
Side_Q_GameNight_Player_109,"I guess we'll see when we face off, right?"
Side_Q_GameNight_Katerina_110,Sure. Let me know when I'm up.
