#,Quest NPC: Temir Umarov
#,Quest Name: Sinking Feeling 
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_SinkingFeeling

#,Asks player to collect materials so he can create thermodynamic heatsinks to impress Litzi. Player has to get a heat sink for final tests. They can ask for it or steal it. 

#,Player gets message to start quest
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_01,"Incoming message from Temir, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_02,I'd like to speak with you about a personal project that might also interest you. Come see me please.\n-Temir Umarov

#,Player speaks to Temir
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_03,"Hey, Temir! Tell me more about your personal project. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_04,"I have a question for you first, if you don't mind... Has Litzi ever mentioned me?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_05,"Not by name, no. Is she involved with your project?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_06,"Directly? No, but I'm hoping to use it to impress her and get a position on her team. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_07,She's already got two apprentices. I don't know if she's looking right now. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_08,"I don't want to knock anyone else out of their spot, but I haven't worked in weeks and Litzi would be my top choice for boss. Better than Tau, that's for sure. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_09,"That's a low bar, Temir. *haha* Maybe I can help, though. What's your project? "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_10,"Well, you know I'm big into thermodynamics. I've been working on advanced heat sink tech that could extend the life of almost any machine. It's unorthodox, but I believe my theory is sound. I just need a few more tests and for you to get me one of the power plant's current heat sinks. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_11,Me? Why not just ask for one?
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_12,"It might not look like it, but the power plant is a pretty restricted area. If you don't have official business there, Litzi is quick to turn you away, and most of the doors are locked out of necessity. I have no leverage there, so a heat sink isn't something I could just ask for."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_13,"...But you could, since you already have a connection with the team. I wouldn't need the heat sink long, either. Just long enough to run some tests."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_14,"Okay, I'll see what I can do. "

#,Player speaks to Temir before getting heat sink
#,Replaces Basic_Temir until end of quest
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_15,I can't wait to get my hands on that heat sink. 

#,When player gets close to Power Plant
#,"Scene should be Player, Litzi, Fang, and Odette, because the whole team makes the decision."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_16,"It is possible that Temir has overestimated your connection to Litzi and her team. Simply asking for the heat sink might work, but we should also consider alternative options in case it is not sufficient. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_17,"Are you suggesting we steal a heat sink, Cassini? "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_18,"That would certainly be an option, yes, but the choice is yours to make. "

#,Player interacts with Litzi
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Litzi_19,"Oh, hey, {PlayerFullName}. What can I do for you?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01,I wanted to ask you about heat sinks?
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S02,Just saying hi. Nice to see you!

#,"Player asks Litzi for heat sink, and has completed Odette's and Fang's quests. Litzi automatically says yes. Her team trusts the player. "
#,Item Litzi gives here is called Tempered Glove. This could just be a throwaway item or we could make it cool piece of gear that reduces damage from energy weapons or maybe it regulate the player's temperature? Maybe it could be an extra item player gets since they took their time and completed the other two missions already. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_01,"What about heat sinks? We have a ton of them all over here. They disperse excess heat generated by the plant, and I wish we had more of them.  "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Player_02,"Well, specifically, I was wondering if it's possible to borrow one. I'd bring it right back, but I wanted to run some tests on one. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_03,"Borrow a heat sink? We need the few heat sinks we have working at max capacity just to keep this power plant going. My instinct would be to say no, but we are a team here, so let me ask the others. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_04,"Odette, what do you think?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Odette_05,"{PlayerFullName}'s a team player. As long as we get it back by the end of the day, we should be fine to give up one heat sink. Fang?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Fang_06,I'm with Odette. The dampeners {PlayerFullName} and I installed underground gives us plenty of leeway in production. We can easily adjust the system to compensate for one fewer heat sink. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_07,"Okay, you convinced me. Take these gloves, and wear them while you take one of the heat sinks. Bring it back as soon as possible, though. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Player_08,"Thanks, Litzi. I'll be fast. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Odette_09,I've unlocked the heat sink room door for you. You should be able to just walk in. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Nar_10,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Tempered Glove</color>'.)"

#,"Player interacts with heat sinks with Tempered Glove on, they get heat sink and get to keep gloves. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Nar_11,"(You approach a wall of heat sinks, glowing red from the mass amounts of absorbed heat, and carefully remove one sector of the heat sink. It fits nicely in your bag after you wait a moment for it to cool down.)"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Nar_12,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Heat Sink</color>'.)"

#,"Player asks Litzi for heat sink, and has completed Odette's quest, but not Fang's. Litzi says yes, but it is hesitant and puts limitations on request"
#,"In this scenario, player does not get to keep the gloves. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_13,"What about heat sinks? We have a ton of them all over here. They disperse excess heat generated by the plant, and I wish we had more of them.  "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Player_14,"Well, specifically, I was wondering if it's possible to borrow one. I'd bring it right back, but I wanted to run some tests on one. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_15,"Borrow a heat sink? We need the few heat sinks we have working at max capacity just to keep this power plant going. My instinct would be to say no, but we are a team here, so let me ask the others. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_16,"Odette, what do you think?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Odette_17,"{PlayerFullName}'s a team player. As long as we get it back by the end of the day, we should be fine to give up one heat sink. Fang?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Fang_18,"Might not be a good idea, since we're still getting energy fluctuations. If there's a spike and we're down a heat sink, that could be catastrophic. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_19,"That is a good point, Fang. Hmmm... well, against my better judgement, I'm going to let you have one. Take these gloves, and wear them while you take one of the heat sinks. Bring it back as soon as possible, though. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Player_20,"Thanks, Litzi. I'll be fast. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Odette_21,I've unlocked the heat sink room door for you. You should be able to just walk in. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Nar_22,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Tempered Glove</color>'.)"

#,"Player interacts with heat sinks with Tempered Glove on. They get heat sink, but gloves are destroyed. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Nar_23,"(You approach a wall of heat sinks, glowing red from the mass amounts of absorbed heat, and carefully remove one sector of the heat sink. It fits nicely in your bag after you wait a moment for it to cool down, but the gloves are rendered useless in the process.)"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Nar_24,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Heat Sink</color>'.)"

#,Player interacts with heat sinks without Tempered Glove on. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_AI_25,The heat sinks are much too hot to touch without protection. You should equip the 'Tempered glove' or 'Protective Glove'.

#,Player Choice
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_AI_25_S01,"(Use '<color=#FFA500>Tempered Glove</color>' to take the heat sink.)"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_AI_25_S02,"(Use '<color=#FFA500>Protective Glove</color>' to take the heat sink.)"

#,"Player asks Litzi for heat sink, but has not completed either Odette or Fang quest. Litzi says no. If Litzi says no, player is forced to go with steal option."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_26,"What about heat sinks? We have a ton of them all over here. They disperse excess heat generated by the plant, and I wish we had more of them.  "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Player_27,"Well, specifically, I was wondering if it's possible to borrow one. I'd bring it right back, but I wanted to run some tests on one. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_28,"Borrow a heat sink? We need the few heat sinks we have working at max capacity just to keep this power plant going. My instinct would be to say no, but we are a team here, so let me ask the others. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_29,"Odette, what do you think?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Odette_30,I wouldn't trust anyone without knowledge of thermodynamics with our heat sinks. My vote is a no. Fang?
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Fang_31,"I'm with Odette. Regardless, we're still getting energy fluctuations. If there's a heat spike and we're down a heat sink, that could be catastrophic. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Litzi_32,"Sorry {PlayerFullName}, the team has spoken. We just can't help you at the moment."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Player_33,"Thanks for considering it, Litzi. I'll be on my way."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_AI_34,Looks like we must go with option #2. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S01_Player_35,I guess so. *sigh*

#,Player doesn't ask about heat sinks
#,This option leaves quest in limbo until player either decides to ask or steal the heat sink.
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ask_S02_Litzi_01,You too. See you later. 

#,"Player decides to steal the heat sink instead. This involves figuring out that they need a specific glove to remove heat sink, producing one, and taking a heat sink when the power plant crew isn't there."
#,When player interacts with door to heat sink area
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Nar_20,(The door to the heat sink area is locked. A sign says 'All Crew Must Wear Protective Gear When Handling Heat Sinks'.)
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_21,We will need a way to unlock the door and the proper gear before we proceed. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_22,"Nothing can just be easy around here, huh? *haha* Any ideas?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_23,I have downloaded plans for a protective glove to handle heat sinks from the camp database. You'll just need the craft materials to produce it. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_24,One challenge down. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_25,Ulf also has knowledge of security systems. Maybe he can help you get through the door.
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_26,And that makes two. Let's do it!

#,Player speaks to Ulf about a keycard
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_27,"Hey, Ulf. You know about security systems right?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ulf_28,"That's the word on the street, yes. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_29,"So, if I need to open a door that I don't technically have a keycard for, you could theoretically make me a crack for the door lock?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ulf_30,"That would be unethical and downright criminal, {PlayerFullName}. I'd have to be crazy to do something like that for you. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_31,Then you won't help me?
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ulf_32,I didn't say that. *haha* but downright criminal activity doesn't come cheap. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ulf_33,Let me know which door you want cracked and I'll have a keycard ready in minutes.

#,Player choice. 
#,"Note: I'm putting 500 credits for this because it was the same amount that Judith asked for earlier from Tau. Be if needed, we can change this to whatever number makes sense. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Ulf_35,Whaddaya say? 500 credits for the keycard you need?
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S01,I don't have the credits. Maybe later. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02,I have 500 credits. Here you go. 

#,Player doesn't pay Ulf (either they don't have the money or just choose not to)
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S01_Ulf_01,Come back when you have the funds. See ya.

#,Player pays for the keycard from Ulf
#,Fade in and out after first line here
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_Player_01,The door I need cracked is to the heat sink room at the power plant. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_Nar_02,"(Ulf leaves for a moment, but returns quickly. He hands you a new keycard.)"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_Ulf_03,"There you go. It should work a handful of times. After that, it'll go dead, as to not be traceable. And, it probably goes without saying, but you can't tell anyone about our deal or we both go down. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_Player_04,"Certainly. I'm no snitch, Ulf. Thanks for the help. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_Nar_05,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Keycard: Counterfeit</color>'.)"

#,When player has counterfeit keycard and has produced a protective glove
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_AI_06,We have everything we need to get the heat sink for Temir now. Proceed whenever you are ready. 

#,Player interacts with heat sinks without protective Glove on. 
#,"I'm no picturing the need for dialogue or popups to get into the door. But I do think it should be impossible to go for the heat sink if Odette, Fang, or Litzi are near by (within X spaces or something). "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_AI_07,The heat sinks are much too hot to touch without protection. You should equip the glove you produced.

#,"Player interacts with heat sinks with protective Glove on. They get heat sink, but gloves are destroyed. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_Nar_08,"(You approach a wall of heat sinks, glowing red from the mass amounts of absorbed heat, and carefully remove one sector of the heat sink. It fits nicely in your bag after you wait a moment for it to cool down, but the gloves are rendered useless in the process.)"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_PayUlf_S02_Nar_09,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Heat Sink</color>'.)"

#,When player returns to Temir with heat sink
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_36,"Tada!!! It took some doing, but I was able to get you a heat sink. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_37,Great work! Let's start those tests right now! 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Nar_38,"(Temir heads to his private lab, and you follow quickly behind.)"

#,Fade in on Temir's lab. Player and Temir are there. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Nar_39,(Temir spent the last hour making considerable changes to the heat sink... upgrades he claims. It is now on the worktable in the middle of the room glowing bright red.)
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_40,"Okay... I've pumped an incredible amount of heat into the heat sink. It's at its limit now, but when I pull this lever my modifications will activate and it should cool almost instantly. Here we go! "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Nar_41,"(You and Temir lower your protective goggles, and he pulls the level. It takes a few minutes, but the red glow of the heat sink diminishes over time to a light pink. The heat index in the room drops as well.)"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_42,It works! It works!
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_43,"Looks like all that thermodynamics work paid off, Temir! You did it!"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_44,"Now that we know it works, we can present my research to Litzi. She'll have to let me on the team after this. "

#,If player was given the heat sink by Litzi
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_45,"Go for it, Temir! I think Litzi'll say yes!"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_46,Thank you for your support. I'm off to the power plant!

#,"X turns after Temir leaves player, he sends a message. "
#,"This should help with power production camp-wide. It should make Litzi Efficient. If she is already Efficient (from Odette's quest), it can reduce raw materials needed to produce energy (stacking with Fang's quest as well). "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_47,"Incoming message from Temir, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_48,"My presentation went over great! Odette and Fang were impressed too and talked Litzi into giving me a job. I'm officially part of the power plant crew! We'll be implementing my heat sink improvements to equipment and weapons across the camp, which should help everyone. I couldn't have done it without you!\n-Temir Umarov"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_49,"Temir is right about his research. I've incorporated the new heat sink tech into your personal equipment, which has improved ranged weapon capacity. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_50,"That's awesome! It's astonishing what you can do with enough imagination, huh? "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_51,"As a product of such imagination myself, I must agree."
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_52,"*haha* Now, let's head out. "

#,If player stole the heat sink
#,Temir gives credits and increased weapon capacity
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_53,"Hold on, Temir. Before you go to Litzi, I should share that I didn't exactly come by that heat sink in the most legal of ways. If you go to Litzi with your research, she might be suspicious about a certain missing heat sink. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_54,You mean you stole it? But the whole point of this was to make a good impression on Litzi!
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_55,"The point was for you to complete your research, and you did that. This is too big to keep from the world. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_56,Except that now I can't share it with the people who could make use of it because of you. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_57,It seems I was wrong to ask for your help.
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_58,"You have it all wrong, Temir. I helped out as best I could. Not getting a job can't compare to proving your research is correct, right?"
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_59,*sigh* I… guess you're right. The science is what really matters in the end. 
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_60,"Here's some credits, and the least I could do is apply my research to your weapons. I'm uploading the specs to your AI. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_61,Processing data...
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Nar_62,(...)
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_AI_63,I've incorporated the new heat sinks into your personal equipment. Ranged weapon ammo capacity has been improved.
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Player_64,"Thanks, Temir. I'll see you around. Keep your research going. "
Side_Q_SinkingFeeling_Temir_65,"I will. Bye, {PlayerFullName}."
