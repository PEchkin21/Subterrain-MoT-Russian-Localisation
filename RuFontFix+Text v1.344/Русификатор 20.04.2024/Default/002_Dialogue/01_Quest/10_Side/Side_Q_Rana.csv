#,Document Outline: Side Quest Dialogue Text

#,Quest NPC: Rana Quadir
#,Quest Name: Seeds for the Future 
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture

#,This mission should trigger after the air circulators have been running for a good while. We should choose how many turns after completing AirCirculation mission makes sense. 
#,Rana is helping Seoyeon with important gene seeds necessary to keep producing food.
#,"player must collect 3 uncontaminated seeds from underground, located near the air filtration towers as that's their best place for survival. Suggest we put the seeds on levels 3, 6, and 9 to spread out what levels the player finds fun stuff. "
#,"After synthesizing the 3 seeds into a single one, this increases food production"

#,Player receives message from Rana
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_AI_01,"Incoming message from Rana, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_02,"I have an idea for improving food production for the camp, but I need your help. Come by Hydroponics when you can. Thanks.\n-Rana Quadir-"

#,Player talks to Rana
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_03,"Hi, Rana. You said something about food production? The camp could definitely use more."
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_04,"Yes, it's hypothetical at the moment, but I've run the tests and it could be possible. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_05,What do you need me to do? I'm here. 
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_06,"Well, Seoyeon and I have grown closer during our time here on Titan. I used to think science was the love of my life before I met her, but she's taught so many things everyday. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_07,"And the latest thing we've been researching together is splicing gene seeds to create more potent and durable plants. Sadly, we've run through our supplies here, but if we could get our hands on an uncontaminated seed here on Titan, then it could mean less hunger for everyone here. That is... if my hypothesis is correct."
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_08,"I know from past expeditions that settlements commonly plant seeds in areas with good soil and airflow to test growth possibilities, and I'd imagine the previous TECC team did the same. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_09,"When I heard you recently found air circulators underground, that could potentially mean there are uncorrupted seeds to be found in those areas. Find me the seeds I need, and this might just work. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_10,"I'm updating your Omniscope with seed analysis software, so we can scan whatever you find remotely. Cassini, does that work for you?"
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_AI_11,"Yes, Rana. I have integrated your software with my program seamlessly. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_12,"Okay, this sounds doable. I'll visit the underground air circulators to see what I can find. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_13,Great! Speak with you soon. 

#,When player speaks with Rana after starting side quest 
#,Replaces Basic_Rana until quest is complete
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_14,Those seeds are crucial for our camp's survival. Keep looking.

#,When player searches air circulators without uncontaminated seeds. Player interacts with Air Circulator to activate text
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Nar_15,"(You search near and around the Air Circulator. Unfortunately, what you find is either contaminated seeds or no seeds at all.)"

#,When player searches air circulator and finds a seed for the first time
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Nar_16,"(Searching next to the Air Circulator, you find a small green blossom. Digging further there are other seeds around it as well, but they are all contaminated.)"
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_17,"This looks promising. Cassini, can you ping Rana?"
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_AI_18,Contacting Rana...
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_19,"Did you find something, {PlayerFullName}?"
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_20,"Yeah, this little fella. It's so strange to see something actually grow down here."
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_21,"That is perfect, but from Cassini's readings, it's far too young to work on its own. Collect that sample now, but I'll need three samples in total for my purposes. When you get two more, come back to Hydroponics. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_22,"Okay, I'll keep looking. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Nar_23,(Communication Ends.)
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Nar_24,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Seed Sample</color>'.)"

#,When player finds samples 2 & 3
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Nar_25,(You find another uncontaminated seed near this Air Circulator and collect it for Rana.)
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Nar_26,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Seed Sample</color>'.)"

#,When player has all 3 samples
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_AI_27,"{PlayerFullName}, that was the last seed sample we needed for Rana. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_28,"Oh, good! I'll bring them to her next time we're in camp. "

#,"When player returns to Hydroponics level, fade in on Rana and player alone in area. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_29,"I'm back, Rana, and I have your samples. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_30,"Your help is much appreciated, let me examine them for a moment. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Nar_31,"(She takes the samples and brings them to her workstation. After a few minutes, she comes back and seems quite satisfied.)"
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_32,"Thank you for helping me do this for the camp, and for Seoyeon. She's going to love this when I present it to her. "
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_33,"The samples you collected should work splendidly. Seoyeon and I have some experimentation ahead of us, but synthesizing these samples into modified seeds will mean more food using fewer raw materials."
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_34,I like that math. 
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Rana_35,You've done good work here. Please accept this for your help. 
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Nar_36,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>' and '<color=#66FFCC>Food</color>'.)"
Side_Q_SeedsForTheFuture_Player_37,It was no problem. I'll be on my way. Tell Seoyeon I said hi.
