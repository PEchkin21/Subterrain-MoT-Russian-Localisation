Log_Main_01_Long,Из прошлого
Log_Main_01_Desc,"After a lengthy slumber, my hibernation device was found by Doctor Shahane, and she cracked it open to bring me back into the world.\n\nThis place is called Camp Huygen, apparently home to several TECC employees...\n\nProbably one of the many camps built on Titan, the largest of Saturn's 83 moons...\n\nMy first goal is to understand the situation at Camp Huygen, like available facilities and each employee's role. Maybe find a reason why they've lost communication with TECC HQ.\n\nFollowing that, I need to locate more info on the missing explorers who came to Titan with me during the first TECC mission. What the hell happened?\n\nI've been told to visit Alp for some food. Let's start there."

Log_Main_02,Лагерь Хайген
Log_Main_02_Long,Лагерь Хайген
Log_Main_02_Desc,"I'm worried for the people here. After meeting most of the residents here, it's obvious they are all on edge and ready to fight over the dwindling resources.\n\nThere's only so much food, water, and power.\n\nMoreover, an unidentified monster made its way through the mine shaft to Camp Huygen. I defeated the beast with a bit of help, but this development is alarming\n\nIf everything continues as it is, Camp Huygen will die along with everyone in it. Whether this occurs from starvation, monster attacks, or the residents killing each other is anyone's guess.\n\nIt's been decided that I will enter the contaminated underground alone. My special nanobots can resist the sickness coming from the mines.\n\nI may be able to gather enough resources to help the camp and hunt down traces of past expeditions to escape the camp.\n\nThere is no other choice..."

Log_Main_03,Центр Управления
Log_Main_03_Long,Headed to the Control Center
Log_Main_03_Desc,"I've found a personal log in an abandoned arcade underground belonging to an 'Ever Gray.' The name strikes a nerve in my memory, but I can't quite remember who they are.\n\nEver Gray and around a dozen other TECC employees hid from the monsters lurking around and called the Control Center for help.\n\nThey had no help to give... \n\nTheir final fate is still a mystery, however. The employees left no trace of what happened to them.\n\nIs it possible that even their bones decayed from the underground's contamination?\n\nThis discovery has revealed some good news for once, though. We now know that the Control Center rests on level 5.\n\nIt should contain all the colony's data and provide more clues to what actually happened on Titan."

Log_Main_04,Два Способа Перещений
Log_Main_04_Long,Два Способа Перещений
Log_Main_04_Desc,"Arriving at the Control Center, I could finally access the systems there. Most of the data was corrupted, except for one record from 'Mark Miller,' a vice president of the first TECC camp. That would make him second-in-command for the entire mining operation.\n\nThe records mention malfunctioning environmental nanobots, some going rogue, self-destructing, or being rendered non-functional.\n\nThe TECC scientists attempted to find the source of the problem but were interrupted when the monster attacks started. There were supposedly vast amounts of nanobot clusters released to accelerate the terraforming process, but they no longer have a presence on Titan.\n\nSolo trips into the mines to gather whatever supplies I can find just aren't going to cut it anymore. Camp Huygen is running out of time, and only TECC HQ has the answers we need to survive.\n\nEven if the mysteries remain, there is a spaceport there that may still be in working order enough to get us back to Earth.\n\nIt feels like a futile endeavor to stay in this camp, though, so we have to reach TECC HQ as soon as possible.\n\nThere are two ways to travel to TECC HQ: Airship or Train. Preparing the camp's airship for flight would require massive effort and cooperation, but the other Camp Huygen resident could accompany me. Then again, it might be quicker to go alone via the service train on level 7.\n\nIt's a consequential choice, but one I have to make quickly."

Log_Main_05,TECC HQ... Finally
Log_Main_05_Long,TECC HQ... Finally
Log_Main_05_Desc,"Stepping into TECC HQ should feel like a triumph, but getting here was only half the battle.\n\nThe stillness, the dead bodies everywhere I look, and the entire building is unsettling, to say the least. I'll need to keep my wits about me, though. If I lose my mind now, I don't have a chance to get off this rock.\n\nLocating and accessing the core systems is my first goal. Hopefully, something there will reveal the truth behind everything that has led me to TECC's doorstep.\n\nI'd pray for success, but nothing I've experienced on Titan would hint at the existence of a god who cares. "

#,[ Log: Location ]
Log_Location_01,Residential
Log_Location_01_Long,Residential
Log_Location_01_Desc,"I reached Basement Level 1 via service elevator and found the residential floor of the previous TECC settlement.\n\nWhen the doors opened, the lingering stench of death was palpable, and the rot was almost too much to handle. Light was sparse, with only emergency power on Level 1, but what I could see was depressing.\n\nThe residents were reduced to skeletons, but it was hard to tell whether they decayed normally or their bones were licked clean by underground creatures. The walls were cracked, and several ceiling sections crumbled, blocking doors and hallways. The few operable machines were corroded heavily, requiring a bit of muscle to wrench them open. \n\nWhatever killed the people here did the same to some of our miners and hospitalized several others. The destruction was worse than described.\n\nIt wrinkled my brain to think of what could cause this. I threw out the idea of anything natural being capable of this level of damage. The invasive nanobots that Doctor Shahane mentioned could be the culprit.\n\nI should count myself lucky that my nanobots let me resist here. From the look of it, no one here even had a chance.  "

Log_Location_02,Mine
Log_Location_02_Long,Mine
Log_Location_02_Desc,"The camp residents told me so many stories about the mines, which I officially reached beginning on Level 1. Finally seeing it for myself was an off experience, however.\n\nIf I didn't already know about the contamination down here, I might have mistaken it for your standard mining tunnel at first.\n\nThat idea was flipped on its head when I encountered the skeletons of recent mining casualties from Camp Huygen. Inches away from the elevator, they tried their best to escape before the mine was quarantined. Nothing could have prepared me for that realization.\n\nDarkness would take over without my lamp, but I could see a faint red glow from the tunnels. My contamination sensors were already off the charts, so I had no doubt there were monsters down here.\n\nCertainly not a place I'd visit by choice, but the camp needed supplies. "

Log_Location_03,Leisure
Log_Location_03_Long,Leisure
Log_Location_03_Desc,"Upon entering Level 2, the sheer scope of TECC's plans suddenly dawned on me. Not only did the company plan to mine Titan for resources, but it also wanted to make it a place people could live for years to come.\n\nLevel 2 was built to offer leisure activities, and the faded signs gave directions to the various facilities. The previous settlement apparently enjoyed a basketball court, football field, Olympic-sized pool, and full gym.\n\nA Level focused on fun is bound to attract more people, so it was no surprise to find several more skeletons, not one of them killed in the same way. It seemed the monsters had their fun as well.\n\nWhile I didn't expect to find raw materials, there should have been plenty of recyclable items. "

Log_Location_04,Park
Log_Location_04_Long,Park
Log_Location_04_Desc,"I half expected the underground park installation to have working artificial sunlight. Emergency power wasn't enough to help me out there, though.\n\nExploring further, I discovered more of this synthetic area. The forever-green grass was made from astroturf, and wood samples from Titan's surface were broken down and shaped into various Earth trees to make the TECC employees feel more at home.\n\nIts massive size was enough to support hundreds of people and beyond. How large could the colony have grown had the first settlement not disappeared?\n\nThe monsters stole more than human lives... they stole our future."

Log_Location_05,Arcade
Log_Location_05_Long,Arcade
Log_Location_05_Desc,"No children were coming to Titan during TECC's first settlements. Still, places like the arcade show that the company was looking to the future.\n\nThe colony's arcade sparked my inner child as I imagined all the screens lit up and video game noises echoing through the room. It almost brought a smile to my face.\n\nReturning to the reality of smashed screens, destroyed machines, and bodies thrown about the arcade was a stark change, but the danger was too much to lose myself to daydreams.\n\nPiles of debris tried to block the entrance, so the arcade was the last stand for these people. Maybe they left some clues behind. "

Log_Location_06,Workshop
Log_Location_06_Long,Workshop
Log_Location_06_Desc,"It's hard not to be impressed with the TECC workshop I found. Judith would love this place, if for no other reason than its row of shelves that were probably fully stocked at one point.\n\nFrom the look of it, the workshop produced general goods for the colony instead of the more inventive creations we get out of Camp Huygen.\n\nNothing was functional. Still, most of the machinery could be stripped for usable parts. Finding a cooling coil or a set of spare tools here would sure to go a long way to help my friends on the surface.\n\nAs the primary workshop, I also hoped to find blueprints for new equipment."

Log_Location_07,Market
Log_Location_07_Long,Market
Log_Location_07_Desc,"I expected to face the most hostility in the market. With the humans eventually reduced to skeletons, it only made sense that the monsters would make their way to the food stores. Hopefully, someone had a hidden stash.\n\nWhat surprised me was how small the market was, but there was lots of room to grow as well.\n\nTECC's initial settlement was meant for employees and workers. Despite the intent, however, the colony seemed to have been evolving into a somewhat functional society.\n\nIf we could uncover the mysteries of what happened on Titan, would it be possible to reclaim the progress already made? Camp Huygen started at zero and wasn't faring too well.\n\nWe had only scratched the surface."

Log_Location_08,Medical
Log_Location_08_Long,Medical
Log_Location_08_Desc,"Medical facilities commonly smell sterile, with almost an absence of the usual scents of the outside world. Titan's medical facility was the opposite.\n\nAn extreme stench hung in the air that made breathing difficult. Ida suspected this was due to the failed experiments during the monster attacks.\n\nThe doctors tried their best to diagnose the cause of the sudden mutations, but medical science is a marathon, not a sprint. They just needed more time.\n\nFinding any leftover medicines could be helpful, however, since the monsters had little to no use for them. Camp Huygen, on the other hand, needs them.\n\nPerhaps there were even clues to be found about the nature of the nanobot sickness. They must have discovered something with the entire staff working together before their untimely deaths, right?"

Log_Location_09,Control Center
Log_Location_09_Long,Control Center
Log_Location_09_Desc,"The Control Center was the brain of TECC's entire colony. Its walls were covered in screens, once connected to the other mine levels to monitor operations.\n\nIt also appeared to have been used as a launch viewing area when shuttles traveled in and out of TECC HQ.\n\nUnlike every other mine level, the Control Center was largely untouched by the monsters. Still, the systems were just as deteriorated as others I'd encountered.\n\nIf there was anything to find about how the colony fell to the monsters, it would be found there... but it wouldn't be easy."

Log_Location_10,Unfinished
Log_Location_10_Long,Unfinished
Log_Location_10_Desc,"Digging deeper into the mine, I finally reached Level 10. Work on the area was started but was ultimately left unfinished as TECC's plans ground to a halt in the face of monster attacks.\n\nTitan's enormous size provided enough room for TECC to have drilled hundreds of levels down or founded dozens of sprawling cities on the surface.\n\nIf their excursions were successful, of course.\n\nLevel 10 was a series of tunnels and a few chambers waiting for someone to add installations. I wonder what type of creatures might have utilized the space for themselves. "

Log_Location_11,The Stage
Log_Location_11_Long,The Stage
Log_Location_11_Desc,"As if the park level wasn't surreal enough, it included a full performance stage that hosted at least a few concerts. I saw a faded poster for Punk Angels and Titan Attacks, so at least the musicians had a sense of humor.\n\nThere are several pieces of musical equipment, some of which would fetch a pretty penny if they weren't entirely corroded. I'd test them out, but that would only attract monsters to my location.\n\nTECC was building a place to work and enjoy the fundamentals of life, of which music is one."

Log_Location_12,Crystal Cave
Log_Location_12_Long,Crystal Cave
Log_Location_12_Desc,"Every step reverberated against the walls upon entering the crystal cave. Even my breath seemed to multiply, giving the impression I was being watched.\n\nThe strange cave was beautiful, though. I was surrounded by wall-to-wall, multi-colored crystals. With just a bit of light, the whole chamber was illuminated. Quite the sight to behold."

Log_Location_13,Fishing Dock
Log_Location_13_Long,Fishing Dock
Log_Location_13_Desc,"Seeing a fishing dock was surprising.\n\nSure, there's nothing more relaxing than pulling up a chair and a pole to potentially catch a fish. However, the water was still green, meaning it hadn't been treated and couldn't support life.\n\nLooking beneath the still water's surface, though, I noticed some non-working mechanical fish that had sunk to the bottom. An imitation of life to prop up an imitation of a peaceful Titan. TECC truly thought of everything. "

#,( Location 13 Event Dialogue )
Log_Location_13_Player_01,Oh my god! We made it across!
Log_Location_13_AI_02,Good. You saw through the bridge's optical illusion. 
Log_Location_13_Player_03,Optical illusion? What do you mean?
Log_Location_13_AI_04,"The bridge seemed invisible, caused by the low light conditions, the crystal growth on the roof, and refraction from a nearby object."
Log_Location_13_AI_05,Did you not know you would immediately fall to a swift death?
Log_Location_13_Player_06,I had to jump in with both feet and just believe it would work. That's why it's called a leap of faith. 
Log_Location_13_AI_07,I thought I knew all there was to know about humans. You've proved me wrong. 
Log_Location_13_Player_08,"You gotta have faith sometimes, Cassini. Without it, you're doomed. "
Log_Location_13_AI_09,Noted. 
Log_Location_13_Player_10,"Now, let's see where our faith has brought us. "

Log_Location_14,Perilous Cliff
Log_Location_14_Long,Perilous Cliff
Log_Location_14_Desc,"I found myself at an impasse, a chasm separating me from my destination. The cliff before me was way too far for me to jump, even with the aid of one of my mini gadgets. Nobody could jump this. What I wouldn't give for a jetpack right about now.\nLooking up, the mysterious glimmering lights from the ceiling, especially this far below ground, made the place feel almost spiritual. What type of holy grail was waiting to be discovered on the other side? Something compelled me to find out... but how would I make it across to complete this quest?\nI must believe it's possible."

Log_Book_TitanFlower_Location_Desc,"Entry #1\n\nI'm starting this journal as part of my agreement with my therapist. She said it'd be good for my mental well-being since leaving Rachel behind has been taxing. And I know I'm going to be gone for a long time.\n\nRemembering our last conversation keeps me up at night. The money was too good to ignore. 'It's going to set us up for life,' I told her. She didn't care about that.

Any day now, she's going to get past-due notices for our house, the car, and all the credit cards. Coming here means she'll at least have the money to pay them off. I hope one day she'll forgive me.\n\nIt breaks my heart to think she won't.\n\nBut still, they needed an expert botanist, so here I am.\n\nEntry #2\n\nThey gave me a week to acclimate to Titan before shuffling me down to Level 10, and what they showed me... I can't even begin to describe it. I mean, I guess I can, but I'm not supposed to. People need the highest clearance to even catch a glimpse of this discovery.\n\nTitan has tons of plant life, and here I thought they brought me here to tend to the crops or something. But this... this was a different creature entirely.\n\nIt's called the Titan Tree.\n\nAll the trees on Titan's surface or on the other levels are manmade, throwing together pieces of the moon's pseudo-vegetation (if you can even call it that) and mixing it with plants brought from Earth. To their credit, the scientists who came up with that are clever. Reminders of Earth help me feel more at ease away from home.\n\nBut the Titan Tree is something else entirely. It's the first Titan-native plant TECC has discovered.\n\nEntry #3\n\nIt's been weeks since I've heard from Rachel. I called and called, but no one's picking up the phone. To keep from worrying about my life back on Earth, I've thrown myself into my work. My therapist calls it a coping mechanism, but I keep reminding myself, 'The faster I finish my work here, the sooner I get to leave.' It might be a cope, but it's also a great motivator.\n\nThe Titan Tree itself has been barren for the most part but has recently started to sprout a few buds. How was it pollinated? Where does it draw its nourishment from when we're miles underground? So many questions still left to be answered.\n\nI now sleep, eat, and breathe the Titan Tree. It's all I dream about. It's all anyone who has seen it can think about. Some of us wonder if this is just scientific curiosity getting the better of us or a side-effect of exposure to an alien plant. If Earth plants can affect the human mind, make us feel and see things we wouldn't otherwise, then why not this one?\n\nCould that be the reason TECC is keeping this top secret? Why they brought me in as an expert to dissect and experiment on it?"

Log_Book_ComicBook_001_DescKey,"Shinzo sat in meditation before Sensei Haru, preparing for his ascension test. The old man held his bokken like a cane and hoped his final student would carry on his legacy. 'Are you ready, Shinzo?'\n'Yes, sensei,' Shinzo spoke calmly.\n'Then prepare yourself,' he shouted as his bokken descended upon Shinzo. He caught it between his palms and twisted, disarming his sensei and forcing him to tumble to his feet. Shinzo also rose to a fighting stance... this fight was serious.\nBefore Shinzo could blink, however, Sensei Haru struck his student's shoulder with a snake strike and the other with a mantis jab. He followed with a tiger's claw to the stomach and an eagle palm strike to the right side of Shinzo's chest.\nThe student fell to his knee as Sensei Haru's dragon punch stopped just before connecting with Shinzo's heart. 'Sensei, was that-?'\n'-Yes, Shinzo. The ultimate attack for those following the Way of Fury. If all five strikes meet their target, your opponent will die in moments.'\nThe feeling in Shinzo's body slowly returned, and he stood back up and bowed to his sensei. 'Please teach me, sensei.'\nSensei Haru nodded. 'You are the only one worthy of this gift. There is so much power in just one finger. Your time here will be complete when you learn to wield all five together as weapons.'\nShinzo trained diligently for years until Sensei Haru eventually passed away in his sleep. To master the technique alone, Shinzo would have to leave the Way of Fury Dojo in search of opponents deserving of his Fury Attack."

Log_Book_ComicBook_002_LongKey,Way of Fury #2: One Fist to Save Them All
Log_Book_ComicBook_002_DescKey,"In a crowded bar, Shinzo sat alone in a shadowy corner booth. He ordered just enough and tipped well, so the service staff gave him his freedom. People-watching had become second nature, and the seat gave the man a bird's-eye view and a less-detectable position.\nThe first bargoer was a loudmouthed, brash man named Asahi. However, Shinzo had done his research and learned that Asahi was a family man. His behavior might have been off-putting, but it was his only outlet from his domestic responsibilities.\nThe second potential target was Junko. Women were not barred from receiving Shinzo's justice, but was Junko deserving of his fist? Researching her past revealed she was indeed a murderer, but it was a last resort. Junko fought for her freedom from a flesh merchant, and Shinzo wouldn't dare take the life she built from her.\nNo, the right target was Bargoer #3, Toya. Nothing was worse than a lousy criminal whose mistakes threatened everyone in the bar. Toya had one of the Emperor's scepters in his possession and flaunted it to make a name for himself. Soldiers were bound to attack any moment due to Toya's incompetence.\nShinzo rose from his seat and walked over to the counter, tapping Toya on the shoulder.\n'Can't you see I'm entertaining these ladies? Beat it!' Toya shouted at Shinzo.\nShinzo looked the man in the eye and struck first. Snake, mantis, tiger, eagle, dragon. . . each strike pinpointed at a crucial nerve. He then turned to walk back to his booth.\n'What the hell was that?' Toya was paralyzed mid-sentence and then crumbled to the floor. The crowd was shocked, but Junko calmed everyone down after a nod from Shinzo. She was a survivor and knew how to maintain the status quo.\nThe Way of Fury quickly toppled Toya. With one attack, everyone was safe."

Log_Book_ComicBook_003_DescKey,"Shinzo stood at the far end of the open field, staring down Daiji the Fierce, who had never been defeated. The world fighter's tournament both of them joined was but a facade, an excuse for this battle to occur. While international plots and psychic-powered dictators swirled around them, only this fight mattered to Shinzo and Daiji.\n'You tracked me all the way here, fought through dozens of challengers, and for what?' Daiji smirked.\n'I know the truth of your deeds, Daiji. We shared a master in Sensei Haru... and you killed him,' Shinzo shouted.\nDiaji laughed off the accusation. 'Oh, that? It was simple, really. I just slipped an extra dose of monkshood into the old man's tea. Neither of you could detect me; the student far surpassed the teacher.'\nShinzo couldn't stand the smug grin on Daiji's face. He took his fighting stance, readying for the challenge ahead. 'I have something to show you then. Sensei Haru didn't teach you everything he knew.'\n'Let's see what you got, little man!' As Daiji sprinted forward, his body began to glow with red, crackling energy. His fist connected with Shinzo's chest, sending him flying across the field. Daiji quickly loomed over him. 'I guess it's time to kill you!'\nBefore he could land the killing blow, however, he felt five impossibly fast strikes hit him. Snake, mantis, tiger, eagle, dragon, and Daiji was on his knees. 'But you're already dead.'\nDaiji coughed up blood, which dribbled down his chest. Shinzo eyed his enemy and watched as life left his body. With his sensei avenged, he could set his sights on greater challenges. "

Log_Book_BFGManual_DescKey,"Bianca Moreira's Plasma Launcher is humanity's most advanced mining tool. Dozens of miners working for days once were needed to do what this fantastic new tool can achieve in minutes. Using proprietary technology patented by Titan Excavation and Colonization Company (TECC), the Plasma Launcher can target large or isolated regions with charged particles that liquefy rock instantly and with extreme precision. These particles also quickly evaporate, leaving the area safe to explore within seconds.\n[The rest of the instruction manual appears to have been destroyed, except for one additional page…]\n...again. The company should have expected issues, but after the prototype destroyed more than its inventor promised, TECC broke it into three pieces and covered up the tech. Bianca, the inventor, was brought to Titan to build a new version but disappeared shortly after being reprimanded. Some say she planned to reassemble the pieces, rebuild the Plasma Launcher, and use it against TECC for insulting her creation. If that's true, I hope they find her before that happens.\nIf you're reading this, you might be tempted to recreate the Plasma Launcher yourself. The pieces were designed to fit together seamlessly and intuitively, but take my advice... DON'T! It's more of a weapon than a tool, and it could bring this whole place down if it fell into the wrong hands.\nYOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!"
