#,Quest:Prototype - Pierre
#,Object: Object_Statue_001
#,"The Pane Of Glass was originally obtainable from church, but the church is now located far below level 10, so we need to change the method how it is obtained."
#,"The Pane Of Glass must be crafted using glass debrie items obtainable from the Large TECC statue, located at the market area."
#,Dialogue when touching the statue.
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_Nar_001,"(Before you is an old TECC memorial statue made of titanium and glass. It's worn and busted, just like everything else down here.)"
#,After receiving quest from Pierre the following choice is made available.
#,Player can obtain special glass debrie that is key material to craft 'Pane Of Glass'.
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_S01,"(Looking at the TECC memorial, the large piece of glass at its center is removable.)"
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_S01_Player_01,"Cassini, can Pierre use this glass for his prototype?"
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_S01_AI_02,...
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_S01_AI_03,"After scanning, I believe its imperfections render it useless."
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_S01_Player_04,Wait... There's a lot of <color=#66FFCC>Glass Debris</color> around the area. Could we use that to fix the imperfections?
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_S01_AI_05,"If we collect enough of it, then our <color=#FFA500>Item Production</color> process can modify the glass accordingly, yes."
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_S01_Player_06,Great! I'll grab what I can.
SideQ_Prototype_Object_Statue_S01_AI_07,<color=#66FFCC>Pane Of Glass</color> has been added to your <color=#FFA500>Craft</color> list once you are ready.

Obj_GridStepPuzzle_Player_02,"Am I missing something, Cassini? There's no keypad to enter a passcode. "
Obj_GridStepPuzzle_AI_03,"Engineer Felix Zuber developed this experimental security system, which uses a series of pressure plates instead of a keypad."
Obj_GridStepPuzzle_AI_04,"Each plate has a specific number, and the correct passcode must be entered from left to right by standing on them in order. Deciphering the code shouldn't be difficult."
Obj_GridStepPuzzle_Player_05,"If it's how we get through that door, then let's give it a shot."

#,"Interacting with terminal before puzzle has been solved, after the first time but before either passing or failing the code."
Obj_GridStepPuzzle_Nar_03,(This security panel is connected to the pressure plate system.)

Obj_DoorTerminal_B05C01_Main_AI_03,"I cannot bypass the system, but I detect a corruption that may aid us. "
Obj_DoorTerminal_B05C01_Main_Player_04,What do you mean?
Obj_DoorTerminal_B05C01_Main_AI_05,"Previously, the consoles would need to be activated within 2 seconds of each other, ensuring the double security protocol stayed intact. "
Obj_DoorTerminal_B05C01_Main_AI_06,"That window has now been extended to 12 seconds, however. "
Obj_DoorTerminal_B05C01_Main_Player_07,"So, if I can make it to the other console quickly enough, I can deactivate security alone?"

#,When player interacts with Titan flower. This dialogue will trigger
#,We want to make so that the the tree is mysterious and beautiful. Scientists would probably been studying this awesomness.
#,Titan flower is regenerative resource in the game so the actual flower which spawns the flower are scattered around the tree.
#,"When interacting with tree, we can make the flower to start being available. The flower units would rise up from the ground, maybe connected from its roots?"
Obj_TitanTree_Nar_01,"(Walking into the restricted area, it is apparent that it was tightly sealed away from the rest of the underground. At the center of the lab is a tall, majestic tree. A colorful flower gloriously blooms before your eyes, drawing you to approach the Titan Tree. The air sparkles from floating spores that give it a magical aura.)"
Obj_TitanTree_Player_02,It's... so... beautiful.
Obj_TitanTree_AI_03,"{PlayerFullName}, I'm reading a change in your adrenaline. We should limit our exposure to this area."
Obj_TitanTree_Player_04,But this is it... The Titan Tree.
Obj_TitanTree_AI_05,The Titan Flower is our objective. We should collect one and return to camp.
Obj_TitanTree_Nar_06,"(You approach the Titan Tree and pluck a flower from its base. Within seconds, a new flower bud grows but doesn't bloom.) "
Obj_TitanTree_Player_07,Would you look at that?
Obj_TitanTree_AI_08,"The Titan Tree's physiology allows for rapid growth. If this flower is useful beyond acting as a memento for Ursula, having a regenerative resource could be helpful. "
Obj_TitanTree_Player_09,Noted.
Obj_TitanTree_Nar_10,"(After gawking at the Titan Flower, you suddenly remember you're in the middle of a research lab. The research equipment lining the walls is untouched by the mine contamination. Instead, they look like they're damaged manually.)"
Obj_TitanTree_Player_11,"Someone wanted to keep this thing a secret. A hidden chamber, hard-to-find passcode, and destruction of all the research data on the way out? What the hell is this thing, really? "
Obj_TitanTree_AI_12,Scanning...
Obj_TitanTree_Nar_13,(...)
Obj_TitanTree_AI_14,"I'm sorry. The data is either heavily damaged or purposefully corrupted, even beyond Pierre's ability to recover. "
Obj_TitanTree_Player_15,"Let's get this flower back to camp, then. We could do some research of our own. "
Obj_TitanTree_AI_16,Agreed.
#,When player leaves the chamber
