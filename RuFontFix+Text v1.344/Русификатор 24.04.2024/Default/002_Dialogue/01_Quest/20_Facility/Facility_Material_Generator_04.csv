#,Prefix_Key: Generator_04

#,Player finds working industrial robot which is powered by Hydrazine. Which explains why it is still running after all these years.

#,When player meets robot
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_Nar_01,"(An outdated industrial robot sits before you. There's something about its design that makes it seem friendly. While parts of the body have eroded over time, it still looks quite strong.)"
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_Player_02,This robot may be useful at camp. Does it still run?
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_AI_03,It is operational but is currently in low-power mode. I detect an internal power source. 
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_Nar_04,(You find the robot's power switch.)

#,Player choice to activate or not
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01,(Activate Robot.)
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S02,(Do Nothing.)

#,Robot operates but null functions.
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_Nar_01,"(The robot's eyes light up and slowly blink until they become solid. It is fully activated, but when it looks your way, its body briefly convulses.)"
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_Player_02,Cassini? What's it doing?
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_AI_03,There are errors in its programming... it sees you as a threat. Get ready!
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_Nar_04,(The robot stretches its joints to lubricate before launching toward you to attack.)

#,"After defeating robot, player finds that the robot was powered by self sustaining small generator which can make Hydrazine."
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_Nar_05,"(With the final hit, the robot lurches and suddenly stops, hitting the ground with a loud *THUD*. Its eyes go dark again.)"
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_AI_06,"It has ceased operation. However, the robot's power source remains active."
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_Nar_07,(You break open the robot's casing and remove its internal generator.)
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_AI_08,Scanning...
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_Nar_09,(...)
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_AI_10,"This is a compact, self-sustaining power generator that runs on and produces its own Hydrazine. This technology is years beyond what Camp Huygen currently uses. "
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_Player_11,No wonder it was the only thing down here with power.
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S01_Player_12,I bet Litzi can make good use of this.

#,If player does not power on robot
Generator_04_Industrial_Robot_S02_Player_01,Who knows how this robot will act? We should make sure we're ready before activating it.
