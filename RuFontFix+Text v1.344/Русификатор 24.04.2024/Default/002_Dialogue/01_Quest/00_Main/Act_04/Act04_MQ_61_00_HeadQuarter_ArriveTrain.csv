Act04_MQ_61_00_Nar_01,"(Traveling to TECC HQ on the supply train has taken its toll on you. Fending off so many monsters along the way was exhausting and wasted crucial supplies. Even in your few moments of respite, you constantly felt this nagging feeling that doing this alone was a mistake.)"
Act04_MQ_61_00_Nar_02,"(Lights above the train's power supply flash red, indicating no more fuel. Returning to camp is impossible.)"
Act04_MQ_61_00_Nar_03,"(Getting off the train, you take in the new environment, which is cold and dark. The only sounds you hear are echoes of the train engine as it powers down.)"
Act04_MQ_61_00_Nar_04,"(Your flashlight reveals dozens of dead bodies scattered on the ground. Long-dried blood is smeared everywhere, and too many severed body parts are flung around for an accurate death count.)"
Act04_MQ_61_00_Player_05,Oh my god!
Act04_MQ_61_00_Nar_06,(You cover your mouth in shock at the sight. The lack of a stench suggests these people have been dead for a while. You tremble at the thought of being alone with whatever did this.)
Act04_MQ_61_00_Player_07,Cassini... are you getting any life signs. 
Act04_MQ_61_00_AI_08,"Zero human life signs, but I detect faint traces of more creatures on the premises, most likely also following through the tunnels. "
Act04_MQ_61_00_AI_09,"Our train faced no barricades or other safety measures as we approached HQ, so this area is seemingly defenseless.  "
Act04_MQ_61_00_Player_10,HQ has been asleep for a long time. Could waking it up restore defense protocols?
Act04_MQ_61_00_AI_11,"My theory as well, but we will not know more until we investigate further. "
Act04_MQ_61_00_Nar_12,"(Things seem dire now, but you've survived a lot to get here. Taking a death breath allows you to recenter yourself.)"
Act04_MQ_61_00_Player_13,"Okay, Cassini. It's just you and me. "
Act04_MQ_61_00_Player_14,Let's finish this.
