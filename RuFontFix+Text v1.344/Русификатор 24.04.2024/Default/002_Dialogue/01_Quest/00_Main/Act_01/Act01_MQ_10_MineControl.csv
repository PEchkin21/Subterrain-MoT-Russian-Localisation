#,KeyPrefix: Act01_MQ_10

#,(Player meets Tau)
#,(Ida already told Tau about player's new ability)
#,"(Tau asks player to <fetch> some equipment from Judith, he asked to be repaired)"
Act01_MQ_10_Player_01,Ida said to find you.
Act01_MQ_10_Nar_02,(The large man looms over you and doesn't seem to know the word 'smile.')
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_03,"You'll address me as Overseer Mogorosi, thank you. The doctor shoulda told you that."
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_04,"She did say you got something special 'bout you. You don't look so tough to me, but we got nothing to lose, so into the mine you go, kid. If you somehow manage to surprise me, though, we can hammer out a deal."
Act01_MQ_10_Player_05,"It might sound strange, but it turns out I'm made for this. I'll be heading in now. "
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_06,"Hold up! You can only descend with the proper equipment. Even if I'm in the clear if you fail, it's in my best interest that you don't. Can't take my piece of the pie that don't exist, yeah?"
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_07,"Also, the mine ain't empty. The creatures down there have lived here longer than us, so there's gonna be a fight to mine the good stuff. Besides that, we can't predict the mine's stability. Gotta protect from rocks falling on you too."
Act01_MQ_10_Player_08,"Good thinking, uh, Overseer Mogorosi. What do I need?"
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_09,Exactly the gear we don't have here at the moment. <color=#FFFF00>Judith has been hanging on to some equipment to run tests and make improvements.</color> Hurry back when you get it. I don't like waiting.

#,(Player meets Judith)
#,(Judith has a grudge against Tau because he always underpay/delay/not paying for the job.)
#,(Judith will not release the equipments unless she get's paid {cec22ced-cec0-440e-9c4e-ff738c0664c5}  credits.)
Act01_MQ_10_Player_10,"Hey, Judith? Overseer Mogorosi sent me to pick up some equipment for the mine."
Act01_MQ_10_Nar_11,"(Judith always seems intense, but she is visibly angry at the mention of Tau's name.)"
Act01_MQ_10_Judith_12,"Yeah?! Well, you can tell him that unless he pays what I am owed, he can suck an egg. <b>A whole dozen of them!</b>"
Act01_MQ_10_Player_13,"I don't work for him, but he'll only let me into the mine if I have this gear. Please, Judith. The camp needs this. "
Act01_MQ_10_Nar_14,(Her anger turns to contemplation. The two sides of herself are at odds with each other.)
Act01_MQ_10_Judith_15,"Trust me, I get it, but even you understand that this camp doesn't run on charity. It's me'life's work crafting this stuff, making things better, but Tau always tries to get me to work for free or nearly free. And that ass-hat is probably the highest paid of us all. "
Act01_MQ_10_Judith_16,"I can't bend on this one. Without those credits, I can't pay for my next project. "
Act01_MQ_10_Player_17,"Alright, how much does he owe for this equipment, then?"
Act01_MQ_10_Judith_18,"Altogether, at least {cec22ced-cec0-440e-9c4e-ff738c0664c5} credits, but likely way more."

#,(Player pays Judith)
Act01_MQ_10_Player_19,I have {cec22ced-cec0-440e-9c4e-ff738c0664c5} credits for you. This is important.
Act01_MQ_10_Judith_20,"Done! For you, not for Tau and his overinflated ego. He still owes me for other work I did weeks ago."
Act01_MQ_10_Nar_21,(You receive <color=#66FFCC>Miner's Uniform</color>.)

#,(Player unable to pay Judith)
Act01_MQ_10_Player_22,Uh... {cec22ced-cec0-440e-9c4e-ff738c0664c5} credits is out of my price range right now. I'll be back.

#,(Player returns with equipments to Tau)
#,"(Tau is most greedy, selfish NPC in the game who cares only making fortune for himself. He seemly tricked player for getting his equipment repaired for free.)"
#,"(Tau allows player to keep the equipment, but it was originally had to be given to the player in the first place.)"
#,(Tau asks Player if he is ready to go down to the mine.)
Act01_MQ_10_Player_23,"Hey. I got the equipment. You owe me {cec22ced-cec0-440e-9c4e-ff738c0664c5} credits, by the way."
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_24,"I've been waiting this long just to hear you're bad at negotiation? You can't be serious, kid. Remember what I said about making a deal? You'll earn plenty of credits with what you find in the mine, so you need to take several seats before things get heated. "
Act01_MQ_10_Player_25,"You better be right. I'm here to help the camp, but I'm not doing it for free. "
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_26,"Help the camp? The mine is the most important part of this circus of a camp. We are a mining operation, first and foremost, so paying for the equipment to do the only thing we were sent here to do makes no damn sense. Without me, no one here would even have a job."
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_27,"And if you listen to Judith, you'll end up just as bitter as she is. The good news is you get to keep mining gear that, in reality, costs several thousands of credits. Consider the {cec22ced-cec0-440e-9c4e-ff738c0664c5} credits an investment in keeping yourself alive down there."
Act01_MQ_10_Nar_28,"(Time is of the essence, so you bite your tongue for now. If Tau is right, then {cec22ced-cec0-440e-9c4e-ff738c0664c5} credits may be a drop in the bucket at the end of this. Plus... you're not entirely sure you'd win a fight against Tau.)"
Act01_MQ_10_Player_29,"Fine, whatever... So I can go in now?"
Act01_MQ_10_Nar_30,"(Tau puts his arm around your shoulder, smirks, and sets his sights on the mine.)"
Act01_MQ_10_Tau_31,"Whenever you're ready, <color=#FFFF00>just say the word</color>. Make sure you're actually prepared, though, cause the mine ain't for weaklings."
