#,Purpose: Get Minerals at Inventory.
#,"Place: Generator, Cave"
#,"Actor: Player, Litzi Vogl"
#,KeyPrefix: Act01_MQ_07

#,(Player asks Litzi for a job)
#,(Job is to get some minerals from the cave)
Act01_MQ_07_Player_01,"I don't mean to bother, but Alp referred me to you for a possible job."
Act01_MQ_07_Nar_02,"(Litzi removes goggles from her eyes and rests them atop her head. She speaks quickly, trying to rush through the conversation to return to work.)"
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_03,Your timing is perfect. We have a million and one jobs to do and not enough people to do them. Are you comfortable leaving camp?
Act01_MQ_07_Player_04,I gathered some mushrooms from the northeast cave for Alp.
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_05,"Man, if I loved anything the way that guy loves cooking, life would be much easier."
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_06,"Anyway, that same cave is also the location of several white methane ore deposits. I need that to keep this place going, but my crew has our hands full with repairs. <color=#FFFF00>The job is to collect the ore for me</color>."
Act01_MQ_07_Player_07,Digging for ore in what appeared to be a mostly unexplored cave seems like a big job.
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_08,"Negotiating already? Okay, fine. Without that ore, the Generator stops working, and we're all screwed, so my back's against the wall here."
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_09,"The higher-ups are ignoring us workers, too busy with politicking and giving the illusion of stability. Truth is, you offering to help is a godsend. So, yes, I'll make sure you get paid more than what Alp gave you. Much more. Will you go?"

#,(Player accepts job)
#,(Player receives tool to help collecting minerals)
Act01_MQ_07_Player_10,Understood. I'll do it.
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_11,Thank you. I'll get back to repairs. 
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_12,"Take this pickaxe. It's kind of old school, but it'll get the job done."
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_12_01,"Oh and I almost forgot, the deep part of the cave will lack breathable oxygen, so take this oxygen canister too so you don't suffocate down there. If you need more oxygen, make request for them to be crafted more for you, or purchase them from camp's shop. I also think Earl sells them too."
Act01_MQ_07_Nar_13,(You receive <color=#66FFCC>Pickaxe</color> and an <#66FFCC>Oxygen Canister.</color>)

#,(Player brings back minerals)
#,(Litzi points to Judith by Engineering for a further job)
Act01_MQ_07_Player_14,"I brought the ore, and it was heavier than mushrooms."
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_15,"Thank you. Glad to see some progress around here. Repairs are almost done but come back later, and I may have more for you to do. Here's your payment. Also, take this as an extra gift for a job well done."
Act01_MQ_07_Nar_16,(You receive <color=#66FFCC>Goggles</color> and <color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>.)
Act01_MQ_07_Litzi_17,"If you need another job immediately, I told <color=#FFFF00>Judith over in engineering</color> that you're willing to explore caves for credits. She could use your help. See ya. "
Act01_MQ_07_Nar_18,(Litzi pats you on the back and heads back to work.)
