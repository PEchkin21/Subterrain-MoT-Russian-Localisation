#,"Player enters the boss 3 room, which is a center of geothermal generator"
Act03_MQ_51_Nar_01,(Your Omniscope displays heat readings in this room higher than anywhere else in the mines. The reason becomes evident when you see magma flowing beneath the platform.)
Act03_MQ_51_Player_02,Looks like this is the geothermal power plant.
Act03_MQ_51_AI_03,"Indeed. The energy here is produced from Titan's thermal core, in addition to several methane-capturing devices installed in the vents. This was necessary due to Titan's atmospheric disturbances making solar energy an unreliable power source. "
Act03_MQ_51_Player_04,"Science really can overcome any obstacle, huh?"
Act01_MQ_51_AI_05,It's pretty great at creating artificial intelligence too.
Act03_MQ_51_Player_06,Don't know what I'd do without you.
Act03_MQ_51_Player_07,Okay... let's go in and see what we're dealing with. 

#,"Player finds the geothermal generator, discovering it is mostly covered by monster mutation"
Act03_MQ_51_Nar_08,"(You can't avoid seeing the massive, pulsating monster wrapped around a large generator. The creature's breathing seems stunted, and each exhale attacks your ears with high-pitched shrills... almost like a warning not to approach.)"
Act03_MQ_51_Player_09,<b>My god!</b> Cassini... please don't tell me what you're about to tell me.
Act01_MQ_51_AI_10,"Sorry, but yes... that monster has fused with the geothermal generator, and it must be slain first."
Act03_MQ_51_Nar_11,(Are you really ready to face this thing? Before you can make up your mind to fight or retreat... it is made for you. The ground quakes.)

#,"Triggers after initial boss03 text, the bridge connected the generator from the way it came from collapses."
#,Bridge collapses because it was hit by fallen debris from the above by quake caused by boss roaring.
Act03_MQ_51_Player_12,...Shit! 
Act01_MQ_51_AI_13,I share your sentiment. There are no escape alternatives.
Act03_MQ_51_Player_14,"Let's get rid of this thing, then!"

#,After defeating boss03.
Act03_MQ_51_Nar_15,"(The monster's limp body falls, finally revealing the sheer size of the geothermal power generator.)"
Act03_MQ_51_Player_16,There's something in there. Cassini-
Act03_MQ_51_AI_17,"-I see it, {PlayerFullName}. Scanning..."
Act03_MQ_51_Nar_18,(...)
Act03_MQ_51_AI_19,It is an <color=#66FFCC>Energy Converter</color> for high-concentration hydrazine.
Act03_MQ_51_Player_20,We found it! Just like good ole Cyrus said.
Act03_MQ_51_Nar_21,(You can get '<color=#66FFCC>Energy Converter</color>' from the geothermal power generator.)
Act03_MQ_51_AI_22,Now we can all escape camp on the <color=#FFFF00>TECC Airship</color>.
Act03_MQ_51_Player_23,Let's go tell everyone the good news.
