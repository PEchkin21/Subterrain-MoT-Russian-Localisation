#,Document Outline: Side Quest Dialogue Text

#,Quest NPC: Idrissi Nouri
#,Quest Name: Maintenance
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_Maintenance

#,"Idrissi asks Player to scan maintenance panels around camp and produce any parts necessary to repair them. After repair, it's easier to get work down. "
#,"The parts needed to repair should be general, not super specialized. The player still has to produce them, but the blueprints should be generally available. "
#,"Note 1: For some reason, Idrissi is the one NPC that I don't see wandering around camp all the time. He's more than happy to spend all day, everyday in the garage. That's where is work is, that's where Cyrus needs. Little else for him on Titan really."
#,"Note 2: Also, I've imagined Idrissi's English not being that great, so whenever I write his speech is broken and technically grammatically correct. So what you read below aren't mistakes."
