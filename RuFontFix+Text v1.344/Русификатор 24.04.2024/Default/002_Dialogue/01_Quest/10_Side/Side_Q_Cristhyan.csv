#,Quest NPC: Cristhyan Oriol Soler
#,Quest Name: Going Plumb
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_GoingPlumb

#,"Triggers X turns after Invasion, however long it would take for Cristhyan to theoretically setup the initial rerouting for the system."
#,"There has been a backup in the camp's plumbing. Player must visit each camp location and check the pipes to make sure they're all good. Most of them are good, except for one that has a cracked pipe."
#,Must produce 'Sealant' to fix and return to Cristhyan.

#,Player receives message from Cristhyan
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Nar_01,"Incoming message from Cristhyan, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_02,"Hey, the camp's water pressure readings have been pretty low. I might need your help to fix this. Please come see me.\n-Cristhyan Oriol Soler-"

#,When player speaks to Cristhyan
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_03,*What's going on?
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_03,"Good, I finally ran into you. Look, the water system isn't looking great right now. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_04,Is there something going on with it?
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_05,"Well, remember that earthquake? Well, it shook more than just the ground. I heard there were full-on cracks in the ground in the Reactor Room, which isn't good. Several of our pipes ran underneath that sector."
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_06,Everything has ripple effects that aren't obvious until we find them. 
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_07,"Exactly! I've been busy installing workarounds and rerouting our plumbing so we can get the water running again, but it's more than one man can handle. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_08,Make sense. What Can I do to help?
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_09,"I need you to run diagnostics at water panels installed around camp. If you hit the Power Plant, Clinic, and Supply Depot... I can handle the rest. Report back if you find the problem. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_10,I'll get started now!

#,When player speaks to Cristhyan before finishing this quest
#,Replaces Basic_Cristhyan
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_11,Still waiting for your report. How're the water systems looking?

#,When player checks water system panel in Supply Depot & Clinic
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_AI_12_01,"Running diagnostics on the water system."
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Nar_12_02,"(Everything is operating normally here.)"
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_13,On to the next location. 

#,When player checks the Power Plant water system panel
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_AI_14_01,"Running diagnostics on the water system."
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Nar_14_02,"(The panel starts to glitch. After a moment, the screen freezes and you hear a creaking sound from the pipes growing louder and louder.)"
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Nar_15,(You've found the backup...)
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Nar_16,"(Suddenly, the pipe bursts and water sprays everywhere and begins to flood the area. This is especially bad due to the possibility of electrocution... you are in the Power Plant, after all.)"
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_17,Cassini...!
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_AI_18,Contacting Cristhyan...
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_19,"Hey, novato, you find something?"
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_20,The issue was at the power plant. We have a pipe burst and water is going everywhere. What do we do?
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_21,"We can't let the Power Plant flood, or the camp will lose all water and power in one fell swoop. Not to mention possible deaths from electrified water."
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_22,"I'm sending you plans for a Sealant Canister. Inject it into the system, and it'll seal the leak. You gotta do it fast, though. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_23,I'm going now!

#,"Depending on how long it takes for the player to produce sealant and then interact against with the Power Plant water system, they will gradually lose whatever water they have in the camp production meter. "
#,"If they do it in X turns, then they lose none, but maybe for every 10 turns they lose more and more. This will make it known that this is an urgent quest to complete."
#,"If they allow like 10 water units to flood the power plant, then we can go to Game Over screen (a hidden (and obviously terrible) ending for the game perhaps?)"
#,When player interacts with the Power Plant water system after producing Sealant
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Nar_24,"(As quickly as you can, you open the sealant slot and shove the canister inside. Since it has no power currently, you use all your strength to rotate it clockwise and activate the sealant.)"
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Nar_25,"(Within seconds, the pipe seals itself, and the leaks are brought to a halt. You can't help but take a moment to yourself, simply breathing with the knowledge that the whole camp was almost lost, but you were able to stop it just in time.)"
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_26,Phew... That was close.
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_AI_27,"Agreed, {PlayerFullName}. We should debrief with Cristhyan right away."

#,When player returns to Cristhyan
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_28,"I knew you were the best person for the job, novato. You did a great job, and our water problems have been solved. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_29,"And with the leak gone and my updated plumbing routes implemented, the camp can actually produce water with less effort and raw materials. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_30,"Oh really? Well, good things happen when we work together, right?"
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_31,"Exactly! And I'll be able to keep up with the plumbing alone from here on out, but since you put in some hard work, take this as payment. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Nar_32,"('<color=#66FFCC>Camp's water resource production amount</color>' has been increased. And you receive some '<color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>'.)"
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_33,Thank you. I'm happy it all worked out in the end.
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_34,"Me too. See you around, novato."

#,"If player isn't able to get the sealant applied in time. Player gets XP only, but no credits (Cristhyan can't spare credits now that everything is destroyed)"
#,"If the pipes are within view of the player, we'll need to initiate the 'fixed' animation without their intervention. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_AI_35,"Incoming communication from Cristhyan, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_36,"Are you okay? The issue got so bad, I had to reroute the flow from my end so we didn't all go down with the ship. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_37,"I was trying to fix it, but I guess I wasn't fast enough. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_38,"Just be glad no one got hurt. The bad part now is that we lost a lot of the water we had, which wasn't much, and the power generator was damaged in the process. This is a huge setback on the progress Camp Huygen was making. It's a damn shame. "
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_39,I'm so sorry. It's my fault. 
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_40,"I'll take my part of the blame too, but we can always rebuild."
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Player_41,And I'm here to help with the rebuilding as well. 
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_Cristhyan_42,You better be. See ya around. 
Side_Q_GoingPlumb_AI_43,Communication ended.
