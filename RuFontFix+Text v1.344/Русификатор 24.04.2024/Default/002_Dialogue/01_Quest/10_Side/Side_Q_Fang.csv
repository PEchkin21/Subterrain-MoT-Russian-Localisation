#,Document Outline: Side Quest Dialogue Text

#,Quest NPC: Fang Zheng
#,Quest Name: Needs More Power 
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_NeedsMorePower

#,Fang asks player to help by placing regulators he designed on each of the power relays underground. Quest done once all relays have a regulator on them. Hopefully this gets him some attention from Litzi. 

#,---------------------------
#,[Needs More Power 01]
#,Player receives message to start quest
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_AI_01,"Incoming message from Fang, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_02,The camp's energy readings have been in flux recently and need some attention. Please come see me when you can.\n-Fang Zheng-

#,When player speaks with Fang
#,"I don't know how many relays there are, but I was assuming one per mine level. If there are more than that, we can just say player needs to place at least 8 dampeners or something like that."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_03,"Hi, Fang... what's this about an energy flux?"
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_04,"Well, the readings have been all over the place over the last week or so. One day we're producing 70k MW of power, tripling the day before and falling to less than half the following day. The integrity of the whole grid is at risk if we don't act immediately."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_05,"Wow, this sounds pretty bad. What is Litzi's take on how to fix this?"
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_06,"As Litzi's apprentice, I've chosen to tackle the situation myself, so... I haven't actually told her yet."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_07,"It might sound selfish, but Odette is Litzi's favorite, what with being the social one who plans birthday parties. She was also already favored since I only joined the team after the mine closed."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_08,"I've designed a power dampener that should integrate with the underground Power Relays and help regulate our energy production. This will be key to showing Litzi that I'm the better apprentice even if I haven't been here long. My dad never believed in me, so I want Litzi to acknowledge my contributions."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_09,But I can only do that with your help... if you're willing. 
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_10,"If this dampener works as well as you say, then you're a shoo-in to take Litzi's #1 spot. And it helps the camp, so it's a win-win in my book."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_11,"Thanks. I'll send you the blueprints needed to produce the dampeners, and just make sure to put one on every relay you find underground. "
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_12,We can activate the dampeners in batches. I'll let you know when they've been integrated into the grid and the issues are fixed. 
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_13,Right on! I'll get to work. 

#,When player has play a dampener on all power relays
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_AI_18,"Actually, that was the final Power Relay that needed a dampener. We can now return to Fang."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_19,Great! I'll visit him when I get back to camp. 

#,When player returns to Fang
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_20_00,About the dampeners...
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_20,It looks like all dampeners are online. Are you ready to activate the final integration?
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_21,Ready when you are.
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Nar_22,(Fang brings the dampener software up on his datapad and presses a big green 'ACTIVATE' button.)
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Nar_23,"(For a moment, the power browns out, and the lights flicker, but then everything fully returns online.)"
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_24,"All readings are normalized. The dampeners worked! We have eliminated a lot of fluctuations, and sending power to the underground should require less power overall."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_25,"You did it, Fang! I'm sure Litzi will be proud of you. "
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_26,"Thank you, {PlayerFullName}. I'm going to go tell her what we did, but take this for your help. Bye!"
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Nar_27,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>'.)"

#,Quest message arrives
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_AI_02_01,"Incoming message from Fang, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_02_02,"Good job installing the first few dampeners. But check in with me when you can. We have more work to do.\n-Fang Zheng-"

#,Talking to Fang after finish installing damper to B01~03 power relay.
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_02_10,About the dampeners...
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_02_11,"You've installed Power Relays on levels 1-3, and I'm already seeing an improvement in the grid, but we need more power. At least double. Dampeners on levels 4-6 should do it. Keep going, and we'll finish this project soon. Anyway, take this for your help so far."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_02_12,Sounds like a plan. I'll get to work.
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Nar_28,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>'.)"

Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_03_02,"I'm getting some great readings from the grid. Come by, and I'll share them with you.\n-Fang Zheng-"

#,Talking to Fang after finish installing damper to B04~6 power relay.
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_03_10,So you have good news about the power grid?
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_03_11,"My celebration was premature, sadly. The grid was stable for about an hour before the fluctuations returned. We'll need to dig even deeper, maybe going all the way down to Mining Level 10. Anyway, take this for your help so far."
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_03_12,We're going the extra mile. Here's hoping Litzi appreciates this. I'll be back.
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Nar_29,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>'.)"

Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Fang_14,Still getting power spikes. Did you place all the dampeners yet?

#,[Power Relay Interaction Text]

#,[When player interacts with power relay without Damper]
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_AI_15,This Power Relay needs a dampener. We should produce more and come back. 

#,[When player interacts with power relay with Damper already installed]
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_AI_15_S02,We've already installed a dampener for this Power Relay.

#,[When player interacts with power relay without Damper this option shows if player has available Damper in the inventory.]
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_AI_15_S01,[Install Dampener]

#,After an animation for the dampener installation
Side_Q_NeedsMorePower_Player_15_S01_01,One more dampener down.
