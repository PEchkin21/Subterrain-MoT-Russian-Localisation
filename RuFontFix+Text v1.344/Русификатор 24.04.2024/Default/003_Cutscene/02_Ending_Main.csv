Ending_01_Nar_01,"{PlayerFullName} reached TECC HQ, defiled with the remains of dead workers left to rot."
Ending_01_Nar_01_01,"After making it to the AI in control of the entire facility and learning the truth behind the existence of an even more significant threat posed by an alien life-form, a clear choice made itself apparent."
Ending_01_Nar_01_02,"Joining forces with the TECC AI, even after the horrendous torture and death it exacted on the people of Titan, or destroying it as a matter of principle and justice. "
Ending_01_Nar_02,"After weighing all options, the highest probability of success came with the most strings."
Ending_01_Nar_02_01,{PlayerFullName} agreed to genetic modifications administered by the TECC AI to save humanity from the alien creature inhabiting Titan.
Ending_01_Nar_02_02,"It was on the warpath, attempting to gather power to unknown ends."
Ending_01_Nar_03,"The grueling battle commenced, with each of their attacks destroying a cluster of nanobots until they numbered zero, which provided an edge against the alien."
Ending_01_Nar_03_01,"It was over before it began, just as the TECC AI planned. A sense of relief flowed through the chamber as the alien life-form's body dissolved molecule by molecule into nothing."
Ending_01_Nar_04,"Suddenly, the TECC AI's voice booms with a vital declaration, revealing another, more sinister aspect to its machinations."
Ending_01_Nar_04_01,"In the most simplistic terms, {PlayerFullName} was no longer a human, forever altered on a fundamental level."
Ending_01_Nar_04_02,"The TECC AI mimicked the alien's DNA structure to create the perfect weapon to destroy it, 'fighting fire with fire,' one might say."
Ending_01_Nar_05,"While it promised passage off Titan, it was a calculated lie designed to incentivize falling in line."
Ending_01_Nar_05_01,"The TECC AI had no plans to ever let an alien-human hybrid leave. After confirming this new reality through bio-scans, Cassini says, 'I'm so sorry.' Leaving was always the goal, but is it okay to steal hope if it serves the greater good?"

Ending_02_Nar_01,"{PlayerFullName} reached TECC HQ, defiled with the remains of dead workers left to rot."
Ending_02_Nar_01_01,"After making it to the AI in control of the entire facility and learning the truth behind the existence of an even more significant threat posed by an alien life-form, a clear choice made itself apparent."
Ending_02_Nar_01_02,"Joining forces with the TECC AI, even after the horrendous torture and death it exacted on the people of Titan, or destroying it as a matter of principle and justice."
Ending_02_Nar_02,"Injustice couldn't be allowed to stand, so the TECC AI needed to be destroyed."
Ending_02_Nar_02_01,"No gifts or persuasion would bring back the people it murdered to enact its crusade against Titan's alien problem. After all, people aren't simple chess pieces to be sacrificed on a whim."
Ending_02_Nar_03,"The TECC AI brought out a robotic prototype, the Titanian, to maintain control of the situation, but failed. The battle was harrowing and ultimately proved fruitless for the AI, and it led only to the destruction of its new technology."
Ending_02_Nar_03_01,"Once complete, the reality of the situation dawned on {PlayerFullName}, who decided it was best just to get the hell off Titan. TECC HQ was coming down fast, and their survival was at stake."
Ending_02_Nar_04,"Cassini programmed the shuttle's launch sequence remotely... so {PlayerFullName} only had to get there. They raced toward the launch bay, but the ground shook as the alien life-form clawed through the floor."
Ending_02_Nar_04_01,"As the building crumbled, spontaneous fires erupted in to block the path, and the alien inched closer and closer, they finally crossed the bridge to the shuttle."
Ending_02_Nar_05,"Upon entering, slamming the emergency button repeatedly seemed an excellent way to shutter the doors, and it worked within seconds… just in time to stop the alien from making it inside as well."
Ending_02_Nar_05_01,"The life-form beat on the shuttle as it launched into space but couldn't break the rocket's ultra-resistant shielding. The alien was engulfed in the combustion below, viewable through the shuttle window."
Ending_02_Nar_06,"With the TECC AI destroyed and the alien evaded, it was finally an opportunity for {PlayerFullName} to rest... who leans against the wall and sinks to the floor in sheer exhaustion."
Ending_02_Nar_06_01,All they can do is hope that the alien was actually destroyed by the rocket's combustion.

Ending_03_Nar_03,"The TECC AI brought out a robotic prototype, the Titanian, to maintain control of the situation, but this only led to the destruction of its new technology."
Ending_03_Nar_03_01,"Once complete, there was still the matter of the alien life-form to deal with."
Ending_03_Nar_04,"The grueling battle commenced, and {PlayerFullName} almost lost without the advantage the TECC AI might have provided."
Ending_03_Nar_04_01,"The alien possessed several forms and seemingly-endless power, but it was ultimately defeated. A sense of relief flowed through the chamber as the alien life-form's body dissolved molecule by molecule into nothing."
Ending_03_Nar_05,"Now, there were no more murderous AIs. No more alien monsters. This reality seemed almost out of reach, but here it was. Titan was now free of all significant threats."
Ending_03_Nar_06,"'It's time to go home,' Cassini says as she remotely programmed the shuttle's launch sequence. {PlayerFullName} only had to get there."
Ending_03_Nar_06_01,"After two draining battles and a few injuries that won't likely heal quickly, moving was slow-going through TECC HQ."
Ending_03_Nar_06_02,"Nothing stands in the way, providing a surge of glorious triumph. Still, staying on Titan wasn't an option."

#,Escape to Train & Cooperate AI & Combat Alien
#,"Player came alone to HQ, Accepted offer from AI and destoyed Alien. But what exactly happened to NPC is unknown. However, Alien threat is over so AI will aid whos left at Titan to survive."
Ending_04_NPC_01,"Each person is the product of their life's choices in the end. The stark reality that returning to Camp Huygen is impossible begins to loom overhead, and it is worrying."
Ending_04_NPC_01_01,"Even if it were possible to repair the substantial damage to the train used to travel to TECC HQ, the issue of insufficient fuel rears its ugly head."
Ending_04_NPC_01_02,"This was always presented as a one-way trip, after all."
Ending_04_NPC_02,"While there is no way to know the fate of the residents of Camp Huygen, the TECC AI graciously agrees to aid their survival as best it can."
Ending_04_NPC_02_01,"Now that the alien threat has been resolved, its first action was to destroy its creations since they serve no further purpose."
Ending_04_NPC_02_02,"Communications with Camp Huygen continued to malfunction, however, so all {PlayerFullName} could do was hope the others survive."
Ending_04_NPC_03,"Titan was safe from the alien threat, but at what cost?"
Ending_04_NPC_03_01,"Work began on reestablishing communications with Camp Huygen, a worthy goal to pass the time and reach them eventually."
Ending_04_NPC_03_02,"Until then, the company of not one but two AIs had to be enough."
Ending_04_NPC_04,"Otherwise, existing alone at TECC HQ meant losing track of the days at times. Sure, it cut down on supply utilization being the only person around, but one can only take so much isolation."
Ending_04_NPC_04_01,"Their days were filled with tiring facility repairs, bouts of loneliness, and scientific experiments to test the limits of {PlayerFullName}'s new alien DNA and the potential threat it may pose to others."
Ending_04_NPC_05,"Looking up at Earth, it becomes unclear whether returning to humanity's homeworld could be possible again. Is Titan all there is now?"
Ending_04_NPC_06,Only time will tell.

#,Escape to Train & Combat AI & Not Combat Alien
#,"Player came alone to HQ, Destroyed AI but escaped alone. What exactly happened to NPC is unknown. However, Alien threat is exist so it is likely that all NPC are perished."
Ending_05_NPC_01,The level of all-consuming destruction caused by the rocket's flame ultimately spelled the future for Camp Huygen.
Ending_05_NPC_01_01,"A generous estimation from Cassini gave an 8% probability of the camp's survival without {PlayerFullName}'s aid, which fell even further to 2% if even a single atom of alien DNA still existed."
Ending_05_NPC_02,"Despite the staggering reality that no one left on Titan will survive, one cannot dwell on past choices."
Ending_05_NPC_02_01,"An ability to compartmentalize and push any negative feelings becomes necessary. The decisions were made, the shuttle was already en route to Earth, and there was no turning back. Time was better spent resting, instead."
Ending_05_NPC_03,"{PlayerFullName}'s eyes fluttered until closed, and a deep slumber took over... returning them, once more, to a familiar dream."
Ending_05_NPC_04,"The top of the badlands watchtower has frozen over. The haunting blizzard has already arrived, and skin blisters and corrodes from the intense, biting cold."
Ending_05_NPC_05,"The blizzard knows it has won, and when its laugh mimics the sound of your voice. Your body shudders not only from the cold but also from the terror of realizing... everything that has occurred and the ultimate fate of everyone on Titan is all your fault."
Ending_05_NPC_06,There is no peace to be found within dreams anymore.
Ending_05_NPC_07,The trip back to Earth will be a long one.

#,Escape to Train & Combat AI & Combat Alien
#,"Player came alone to HQ, Destroyed AI and Alien. What exactly happened to NPC is unknown. However, Alien threat is exist so it is likely that all NPC are perished."
Ending_06_NPC_01,"The road forward was still unclear, however. {PlayerFullName} stood alone in a tower of death, with all possible allies left behind."
Ending_06_NPC_01_01,"Boarding the shuttle to Earth was the easiest choice, but what about returning to camp? What would become of them?"
Ending_06_NPC_02,"The alien was destroyed, and the heinous actions of the TECC AI were avenged. However, the TECC AI kept the mutated and contagious creatures from taking over the surface."
Ending_06_NPC_02_01,Without the AI's manipulations those monsters were now simple wandering beasts and their return to the surface and invasion of Camp Huygen was inevitable. Not a matter of if but when.
Ending_06_NPC_03,"Each person is the product of their life's choices in the end. The stark reality that returning to Camp Huygen is impossible begins to loom overhead, and it is worrying."
Ending_06_NPC_03_01,"Even if it were possible to repair the substantial damage to the train used to travel to TECC HQ, the issue of insufficient fuel rears its ugly head. This was always presented as a one-way trip, after all."
Ending_06_NPC_04,"It is hard not to immediately succumb to this crushing reality. Camp Huygen is doomed, and there is only one person to blame."
Ending_06_NPC_04_01,"We'll return to Earth alone,' {PlayerFullName} spoke into the universe accepting this fate and hobbling to the shuttle. The illuminated 'Now Boarding' sign flashed in an attempt to be a beacon of hope, the last depressing experience Titan has to give."
Ending_06_NPC_05,"Cassini initiates the launch, but the trip home will be extensive. More than enough time to get the story straight. How did all this happen? Why was everyone else left to die?"
Ending_06_NPC_06,{PlayerFullName} will be expected to answer for it all.

#,Escape to Airship & Cooperate AI
#,"Player came to HQ with NPC, Accepted offer from AI and destoyed Alien. NPC leaves Titan without player"
Ending_07_NPC_01,"Asking Cassini to patch communication through to Ida, {PlayerFullName} relayed as much information as possible. The immediate threat was gone, so Ida and Claudia needed to urge everyone to the shuttle to depart to Earth. "
Ending_07_NPC_02,"As astute as always, Ida picked up on an eerie calmness in the conversation. “Your bio-scans are through the roof, so how are you speaking so softly?"
Ending_07_NPC_02_01,"You sound like you're not coming with us,” Ida says, but communications are abruptly cut to avoid prolonged emotional goodbyes."
Ending_07_NPC_02_02,"This may not be the nicest way to leave things, but the people of Camp Huygen may not go if they hold on to someone who cannot accompany them. They'd be better off, though."
Ending_07_NPC_03,"The residents of Camp Huygen and the hope of very humanity leave on that shuttle. As the rumble of its engines faded into the distance, {PlayerFullName} was reminded of the situation and began settling into a life of solitude."
Ending_07_NPC_03_01,"You and me against the world, right, Cassini,' {PlayerFullName} chuckled. The goal became rebuilding Titan into the beacon of human ingenuity it was initially meant to be."

Ending_07_NPC_04,"Existing alone at TECC HQ was difficult, but there was still something to fight for. Sure, it cut down on supply utilization being the only person around, but one can only take so much isolation."
Ending_07_NPC_04_01,"Their days were filled with tiring facility repairs, bouts of loneliness, and scientific experiments to test the limits of {PlayerFullName}'s new alien DNA and the potential threat it may pose to others."
Ending_07_NPC_05,Is it possible to rejoin humanity one day? What stories will those who left tell about their time on Titan? Will anyone ever return?
Ending_07_NPC_06,Only time will tell.

#,If Freyja is GF
Ending_07_NPC_07,"It soon became apparent, however, that they were not truly alone. {PlayerFullName}'s heart melted at the sight of Freyja and her choice to stay behind."
Ending_07_NPC_07_01,"'The purpose of beauty is to share it with the one you love,' she said. Indeed, there was so much of Titan for the two to explore together. After a long, passionate embrace, it was good that the presence of alter-alien DNA didn't immediately melt her face off."
Ending_07_NPC_08,"Their days were filled with tiring facility repairs, bouts of loneliness, and scientific experiments to test the limits of human-alien hybrid DNA and the potential threat it may pose to others."
Ending_07_NPC_08_01,"But anything can be accomplished with someone sharing the duties, and with Freyja there... loneliness was rarely a factor."
Ending_07_NPC_09,Is it possible to rejoin humanity one day? What stories will those who left tell about their time on Titan? Will someone return to Titan only to meet the first child born from an alien-human hybrid?
Ending_07_NPC_10,Only time will tell.

#,If Nina is GF
Ending_07_NPC_11,"It soon became apparent, however, that they were not truly alone. {PlayerFullName}'s nerves were put at ease at the sight of Nina and her choice to stay behind."
Ending_07_NPC_11_01,"'You'd never survive with you anyway,' she laughed... and she wasn't really wrong. After a long, passionate embrace, they were both delighted that the presence of altered alien DNA didn't immediately melt her face off."
Ending_07_NPC_12,"Their days were filled with tiring facility repairs, bouts of loneliness, and scientific experiments to test the limits of human-alien hybrid DNA and the potential threat it may pose to others. Nina stayed true to her word, as well, and the couple two not only survived the perils of Titan but thrived in the environment."
Ending_07_NPC_13,Is it possible to rejoin humanity one day? What stories will those who left tell about their time on Titan? Will someone return to Titan only to meet the first child born from an alien-human hybrid?

Ending_08_NPC_01_01,"The immediate threat was gone, so Ida and Claudia needed to urge everyone to the shuttle to depart to Earth."
Ending_08_NPC_02,Ida remarked on adrenaline levels and injuries that needed attention but agreed to move beyond that until everyone was safely on the shuttle to Earth.
Ending_08_NPC_02_01,"It wouldn't be 100% safe, however. . . even though all major threats had been destroyed, several mutant creatures wandered the moon's surface, and they were out for blood. Getting the hell off Titan was the only real chance at survival."
Ending_08_NPC_03,"The monumental nature of what was accomplished could not be understated, however. And before the shuttle doors closed, inhaling Titan's air one last time seemed like a good choice, the final reminder of time on the moon."
Ending_08_NPC_03_01,"The rocket rumbled during takeoff, strangely lulling {PlayerFullName} into a deep sleep and returning them to a familiar dream..."
Ending_08_NPC_04,"The view from the badlands watchtower was now the most beautiful thing ever. Lush grass sprawled below in vibrant green, while the clear skies above twinkled every possible star known to man and beyond."
Ending_08_NPC_05,The fire inside the watchtower held firm and resisted the hellish blizzard that died in the distance. It burned with the passion of friends and chosen family who fought to survive together.
Ending_08_NPC_05_01,"Laughter from every resident of Camp Huygen echoed, filling the dreams with a sense of euphoria."
Ending_08_NPC_06,"Dreams were again a place to find peace, a welcome change since awakening from the cryostasis pod. "
Ending_08_NPC_07,Now the group just had to survive the journey to Earth in one piece.

#,Escape to Airship & Combat AI
#,"Player came to HQ with NPC, Destroyed AI but didn't destroy Alien NPC leaves Titan with player."
#,This replaces the previous Destroy AI/Not Destroy Alien ending.
#,"NPCs who die in the process should be those without completed side quests first. If the player completed everyone's side quests, then the selection is random. People should die, though, since the player has decided to no destroy the alien before leaving. Except Ida, since I've given her the speaking role at the end. "
Ending_09_NPC_01,"{PlayerFullName} reached TECC HQ, defiled with the remains of dead workers left to rot."
Ending_09_NPC_01_01,"After making it to the AI in control of the entire facility and learning the truth behind the existence of an even more significant threat posed by an alien life-form, a clear choice made itself apparent."
Ending_09_NPC_01_02,"Joining forces with the TECC AI, even after the horrendous torture and death it exacted on the people of Titan, or destroying it as a matter of principle and justice. "

Ending_09_NPC_04,"Cassini programmed the shuttle's launch sequence remotely, so they just had to escape."
Ending_09_NPC_04_01,"After patching through to Ida, {PlayerFullName} relayed information in short, breathless bursts due to the immense pressure weighing them down."
Ending_09_NPC_04_02,"Sure, the immediate threat was gone, but even more was around the corner. Ida and Claudia needed to urge everyone to the shuttle to depart to Earth."
Ending_09_NPC_05,"Everyone raced toward the launch bay, the rest of the group even catching up with {PlayerFullName} due to their injuries."
Ending_09_NPC_05_01,The group was interrupted by the ground shaking and the alien life-form clawing through the floor behind them.
Ending_09_NPC_05_02,"Before the group got too far, the ground shook, and the alien life-form clawed its way through the floor, nearly ripping through Alp. Dalton fired at the alien while Ulf and Seble lifted Alp to carry him the rest of the way. "
Ending_09_NPC_06,"Despite the shock of almost losing a friend, the building crumbling everywhere, spontaneous fires erupting to block paths, and the terrifying alien creature inching closer and closer to the group running for their lives, everyone reaches the bridge to the shuttle."
Ending_09_NPC_06_01,"Unfortunately, everyone couldn't cross in time, and the alien inevitably caught up. With a swipe of its claws, the alien destabilized the bridge and cut Mr. Lao into several bloody pieces, stunning the group."
Ending_09_NPC_06_02,"As the bridge collapsed, Claudia jumped forward to take on the alien herself, providing cover fire to give the others time to board. Seeing Isko lose his footing, she lunged forward to grab his hand before he fell to his death, but this opened her up to a spew of acid from the alien. Claudia's armor held firm, but the acid left her scarred in places with less protection."
Ending_09_NPC_07,"The rest of the group survived to enter the shuttle, and Cassini initiated the shuttle launch as quickly as possible. Looking down at the surface, the alien roared angrily as the shuttle shot into space. Humanity had relinquished control of Titan to that creature, but at least it won't reach Earth."
Ending_09_NPC_08,"After reaching a safe distance from Titan, Ida called for {PlayerFullName}'s arrest, citing a disregard for safety in getting people to the shuttle and a lack of follow through in ridding Titan of all the major threats. These actions (or inactions) led to the death of friends and comrades she could not stand for. This rift split the group into those who were simply content to be alive and those who called for accountability. The journey to Earth will be filled with strife and in-fighting, but it's better than being dead, right?"
Ending_09_NPC_09,"Everything will be settled once the shuttle arrives on Earth, and that's a long journey away."

Ending_10_Mankind_01,But...
Ending_10_Mankind_02,"In the cold, black void of space, as dying stars shine from light-years away, a single alien cell rests on the shuttle headed toward Earth. "
Ending_10_Mankind_03,"The rocket's shields are at full power, a necessity for surviving the harsh environments during the journey. These shields also block all scanning possibilities, so the shuttle hull is the perfect place to undergo mitosis."
Ending_10_Mankind_04,That single cell won't be alone for long... and it can't wait to visit humanity's homeworld.
