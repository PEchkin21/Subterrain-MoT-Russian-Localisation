Ending_Alexei_01,"The most shocking thing Alexei saw on Titan wasn't the abundance of monsters or the death of his fellow workers. It was the realization that all this resulted from corporate overreach and technological hubris. In addition to ensuring everyone would receive adequate pay for their trauma, Alexei decided to take down TECC as a corporate entity. "
Ending_Alexei_02,"Alexei hoped the allies he acquired at Camp Huygen would join him. After all, each of them had ample reason to take up the cause. "

Ending_Alp_Default_01,"Alp was the face of Camp Huygen, the jolly person who helped to put smiles on faces. His smile disappeared, however, when boarding the shuttle to Earth. There were reasons Alp ended up on Titan, and all those reasons would soon come crashing down again."
Ending_Alp_Default_02,"At least he had friends like Miriam, Ulf, and {PlayerFullName} by his side. Alp would continue his culinary pursuits and hoped his allies would not judge his past too harshly."

Ending_Alp_Alien_01,"Alp was the face of Camp Huygen, the jolly person who helped to put smiles on faces. But after the attack from the alien, his health worsened, and his mood altered. The man was no longer the same old Alp. No longer did he smile. No longer did he jest."
Ending_Alp_Alien_02,"Miriam and Ida tended to Alp's wounds as best they could, but his fate was uncertain with limited medical supplies and a long journey ahead. "

Ending_Brett_Default_01,"Brett left Titan the same way he arrived, yearning for adventure and new experiences. While Titan was the first place he'd ever encountered monsters and seen friends die in front of him, that's not the kind of trip he had in mind."
Ending_Brett_Default_02,"His time on the Camp Huygen security team wasn't a complete waste. Working with friends like Claudia and Vinh increased Brett's confidence, and he's looking forward to the next new world he gets to explore."

Ending_Brett_SQ_01,"Brett packed very little when everyone rushed to leave Titan, but he made sure to grab the geodes {PlayerFullName} found for him in the mines. Each one holds a connection to the adventure and experience of his time on Titan."
Ending_Brett_SQ_02,"Along with the friends he's made on the Camp Huygen security team, Brett planned to have the geodes appraised and examined, perhaps lending to future geological breakthroughs on Earth."

Ending_Claudia_Default_01,"TECC lied about the operation on Titan, and Claudia wasn't too happy about how this reflected on her judgment. She trusted no one for much of her life, but TECC executives somehow spun just the right tale to convince her to leave Earth. Did they believe she was the best suited for the job in case the second Titan settlement met the fate of the first, or was she just expendable?"
Ending_Claudia_Default_02,"When she got to Earth, Claudia planned on walking straight into the TECC corporate offices to demand answers. "

Ending_Claudia_Alien_01,"Claudia thought she was done for when she faced down the alien life-form, but putting her life on the line was her job. Even if TECC withheld vital information to get her to Titan and the entire camp was forgotten once things went south, her duty never changed. Claudia was loyal to the people of Camp Huygen even if she never felt like a part of the group. "
Ending_Claudia_Alien_02,"After her heroic act and resulting injury, sure to leave permanent scars, however, Claudia was met only with friendship. She had proven herself and would have allies upon arriving on Earth. TECC had explaining to do. "

Ending_Cristhyan_Default_01,"Cristhyan was more than happy to blend into the background, doing the thankless jobs the others never even considered. The same extended to life on the shuttle, as he took on maintenance duties to ensure they all made it back to Earth. "
Ending_Cristhyan_Default_02,"His old life had its issues, and he thought Titan could solve them. Cristhyan had to find a new way to dig his way out of financial ruin now since Titan didn't work out."

Ending_Cristhyan_SQ_01,"Cristhyan was more than happy to blend into the background, doing the thankless jobs the others never even thought about. The same extended to life on the shuttle, as he took on maintenance duties to ensure they all made it back to Earth. "
Ending_Cristhyan_SQ_02,"After saving Camp Huygen from faulty water pipes, however, his true value became evident. Cristhyan was no longer overlooked or taken advantage of. He made new allies capable of helping him reclaim his life once the shuttle touched down. "

Ending_Cyrus_Default_01,"Cyrus's stay on Titan lasted too long for his mind. He had finally retaken to the air in the airship, but it took everything in him to get everyone to TECC HQ safely. When the time came to pilot the extended trip back to Earth, his depression just wouldn't allow it."
Ending_Cyrus_Default_02,"He took a backseat while Jozef piloted, and Cyrus spent the rest of the journey in therapy with Ida to avoid a mental break. Getting to Earth quickly just became even more crucial. "

Ending_Cyrus_SQ_01,"Cyrus couldn't wait to get off Titan... the air was stale, and there were few opportunities to fly. He even hit a rough patch with his depression, but {PlayerFullName} helped him when he needed it most. Now, he was ready to take command of the shuttle and ensure everyone's safety on the way home. "
Ending_Cyrus_SQ_02,They could rest comfortably knowing Cyrus was at the wheel. 

Ending_Dalton_Default_01,"Everyone thought Dalton was crazy to take a security contract on Titan, but his career goals had stalled, and nothing was working out on Earth. He tried something different, though, even if it ended in catastrophe. "
Ending_Dalton_Default_02,"Would he return to taking private detective cases, or was another security contract in his future? No one knew, but Dalton had the shuttle trip to decide. Until then, he just enjoyed what little time he had without all the answers.  "

Ending_Dalton_SQ_01,"Everyone thought Dalton was crazy to take a security contract on Titan, but his career goals had stalled, and nothing was working out on Earth. He tried something different, though, even if it ended in catastrophe. "
Ending_Dalton_SQ_02,"After taking down Tau, his hunger for justice and faith in the system was renewed. Dalton decided then and there to do more than taking cases as a private dick or pulling all-nighters as security. He would join law enforcement officially and make Earth a better place to live."

Ending_David_01,David had two go-bags ready just in case shit hit the fan at Camp Huygen: one full of recordings of his favorite movies and another with enough guns to arm a small army. He patted his allies on the back and cuddled up with them for movie nights. 
Ending_David_02,"Preparedness was his specialty, though. David could handle whatever awaited the group on Earth, good or bad."

Ending_Earl_01,"Earl Running Wolf was responsible for doling out Camp Huygen's water supply and used that to curry good favor. He put on an air of spirituality to appear above board, but no one knew the truth... he worked with Tau the whole time to rip off the Camp."
Ending_Earl_02,"Together, the two stowed supplies, embezzled credits, and corrupted systems that would give them leverage. However, Tau's arrogance made him a target, and Earl was better at hiding his true intention."
Ending_Earl_03,"In the end, Titan delivered a windfall for Earl, and he returned to Earth a rich man."

Ending_Fang_Default_01,"Fang spent most of his time on Titan trying to prove himself to someone. First, his father, then Odette and Litzi, but he could never prove his worth to himself. Perhaps he'd find another chance in the future. "
Ending_Fang_Default_02,He wasn't looking forward to returning to Earth with so many unresolved personal issues. 

Ending_Fang_SQ_01,"Fang spent most of his time on Titan trying to prove himself to someone. First his father, then Odette and Litzi, but his work with {PlayerFullName} on the power grid finally proved something to himself. "
Ending_Fang_SQ_02,"A newly empowered, resolute Fang was finally returning to Earth with plans to make something of himself in the future. "

Ending_Freyja_01,"While Titan was interesting, Freyja's soul still felt like it needed to be fulfilled. She spent most of the journey to Earth curating photos from the moon, editing them for peak artistic impact, and searching for something to inspire her."
Ending_Freyja_02,"Maybe she'd find it, but maybe there was still something greater out there for her to discover. Good thing she wasn't alone in this search. "

Ending_Gin_Default_01,"Leaving Titan was less than optimal for Mr. Lao. Though the camp was in shambles, he had carefully orchestrated events to place himself as the de facto leader and was instrumental to everyone's survival. Heading back to Earth, however, meant he would no doubt fall back under his family's control."
Ending_Gin_Default_02,"He spent his time on the shuttle, endearing himself to the group again, as they would be valuable tools when they returned home. Mr. Lao had his sights on a new leadership position within TECC, which should be easy to swing in exchange for keeping quiet about the events on Titan."

Ending_Gin_Alien_01,"Mr. Lao was the unfortunate victim of the alien life-form, but it almost seemed fitting. He built a connection to life on Titan that couldn't be denied, making it an excellent resting place."

Ending_Grace_Default_01,"Grace came to Titan with an ulterior motive to discover what had happened to her brother, Jacob. Unfortunately, Camp Huygen went haywire, and now she was on a shuttle back to Earth without the answers she sought. "
Ending_Grace_Default_02,The Thompson family had hoped for closure but would never be granted that peace. 
Ending_Grace_SQ_01,"Grace came to Titan with an ulterior motive to discover what had happened to her brother, Jacob. Luckily, {PlayerFullName} found not only Jacob's final resting place but did the same for several others. "
Ending_Grace_SQ_02,She was already working on plans to build a memorial on Earth to remember all those lost on Saturn's moon.

Ending_Ida_Default_01,"Titan was a fascinating time for Ida. The danger was occasionally overwhelming, but the rush of discoveries and medical breakthroughs was sure to fuel her research for the rest of her life. Ida was right to take {PlayerFullName} out of cryostasis, which she believed was still the key to discovering so much more. "
Ending_Ida_Default_02,Ida began laying the groundwork to bridge nanotechnology and medicine on Earth and bring both fields to the next level. She was more determined than ever to make a name for herself and stay close to {PlayerFullName}.

Ending_Ida_Alien_01,"The urge to keep Camp Huygen safe motivated Ida just as much as her obsession with the first TECC team during her time on Titan. However, seeing the alien life-form up close and personal only intensified her determination. She retained the research from experimentation on {PlayerFullName} but could no longer trust their judgment. If they were no longer the hero, Ida would have to be."
Ending_Ida_Alien_02,"Ida spent her time awaiting Earth drawing plans to bring down {PlayerFullName} and bring the others to her way of thinking. When the shuttle landed, her war would begin. "

Ending_Idrissi_01,"Idrissi always did good work on Titan, but work was work, and there was always another job somewhere. Leaving Titan, not leaving Titan, it didn't matter. Idrissi would be Idrissi regardless of where he was. "
Ending_Idrissi_02,"He was just happy to live another day and to continue working. The fact that his comrades survived Titan with him was a bonus, though. "

Ending_Isko_Default_01,"Isko was one of the few Camp Huygen residents who seemed excited to return to Earth, which seemed odd. Everyone else seemed to be experiencing inner turmoil over their circumstances, but Isko could wait to see the Philippines and his old friends again. Titan provided a few good times but also a lot of potentially deadly situations as well. "
Ending_Isko_Default_02,"Regardless of the future, he would first be loyal to Ida. Her research was too important, and Isko wanted to join her in changing the world. "

Ending_Isko_Alien_01,"Isko's loyalty to Ida extended to all aspects of his life, including her new crusade against {PlayerFullName}. The once funny and charming medical expert turned into a cold observer during the trip to Earth. He watched everyone's movements and chose the most opportune time to turn each of the others to their side."
Ending_Isko_Alien_02,"Ida was his general, and Isko was the perfect soldier. With their minds working together, they could bring down any opponent, including TECC and {PlayerFullName}, who TECC inadvertently created. "

Ending_Jozef_01,"Money problems perpetually haunted Jozef, and financial hardship was why he was on Titan. Cyrus's referral helped him land the job, but now he was returning to Earth, where he'd have to start over with nothing. "
Ending_Jozef_02,"Once again, however, Cyrus had his back and was sure to intervene on Jozef's behalf. He hated the handout but would be eternally loyal to Cyrus. In the meantime, all he could do was throw a few more game nights to distract the others from their hardships."
Ending_Jozef_03,That was the kind of person Jozef was. 

Ending_Judith_AI_01,"Titan was an opportunity Judith couldn't pass up. A place where she would be challenged, where she could research new tech, and hopefully invent ways for humanity to overcome. In many ways, she accomplished this goal, but leaving so many of her inventions behind hurt her deep down. "
Ending_Judith_AI_02,"After hearing that {PlayerFullName} was staying behind because of the TECC AI, Judith planted a surveillance device in a secret compartment in the airship. If discovered, it would make it much easier to establish communications with Earth and open the possibility of recovering the prototypes she left at Camp Huygen. "
Ending_Judith_AI_03,Judith had no intention of leaving {PlayerFullName} on Titan alone forever. 

Ending_Judith_NoAI_01,"Titan was an opportunity Judith couldn't pass up. A place where she would be challenged, where she could research new tech, and hopefully invent ways for humanity to overcome. In many ways, she accomplished this goal, but leaving so many of her inventions behind hurt her deep down. "
Ending_Judith_NoAI_02,"Luckily, she was great at making notes and put a tracking device on her invention notebook since the last time. It would take hard work, but Judith would rebuild everything she lost by leaving Titan. Pierre had already promised her assistance and was talking to his brother about coming aboard."
Ending_Judith_NoAI_03,"Finding funding would be tricky, but she made many friends in Camp Huygen, so the possibilities were endless. "

Ending_Katerina_01,"The excursion to Titan ended as a partial bust. Katerina only took the mining contract to pay cryostasis facility fees for her son, Evan. She never opened up about him and concealed her emotional pain with sarcasm and rudeness instead."
Ending_Katerina_02,"There was hope, though. Meeting so many amazing people, including Ida, could be the key to curing Evan's sickness and unfreezing him. Relying on others would be necessary, but Katerina knew she had people who supported and cared for her now. "

Ending_Litzi_01,Litzi thought she'd be happier off-world but felt calm at the thought of returning home and handling her unfinished family business. Litzi had survived something on Titan that far surpassed the unfortunate events that led her to take the contract. 
Ending_Litzi_02,"She was tired of never having enough and constantly needing to make do with what was available. Litzi missed her luxurious life and was ready to reclaim it. Looking around at her new allies... no, her new friends... Litzi wasn't afraid anymore."
Ending_Litzi_03,Litzi finally had a reason to fight and was done making her father wait.

Ending_Martin_01,"Titan was full of danger, killed dozens of people, pushed Martin to the edge of what he thought was possible... and gave him a fantastic story for his memoirs. The drama! The suspense! "
Ending_Martin_02,"Martin spent the trip to Earth writing everything down, even picking {PlayerFullName}'s brain for details of the mine he wasn't privy to. His book would undoubtedly go on to sell millions, right?"

Ending_Miriam_Default_01,"Miriam had devoted her life to service for her friends and family and the residents of Camp Huygen. Even if circumstances forced their evacuation from the moon, she was still proud that she had a part in keeping spirits up, minds stable, and bellies full. "
Ending_Miriam_Default_02,"Upon returning to Earth, Miriam planned to become a therapist or mediator to help even more people. "
Ending_Miriam_Alien_01,"Miriam had devoted her life to service for her friends and family and the residents of Camp Huygen, which became an urgent necessity after Alp's injuries left him in a bad state. For most of the trip back to Earth, Miriam's duty was to Alp, who was not only her Titan employer but also one of her best friends. "
Ending_Miriam_Alien_02,She would never forgive {PlayerFullName} for choices that led to hurting Alp. Miriam was good at holding grudges.

Ending_Nina_Default_01,"Nina was on edge almost every day on Titan. She'd wake up and think, 'Today could be my last,' before putting on her uniform and securing Camp Huygen. With the introduction of killer diseases and monsters in the mines, Nina's emotions proved to be entirely justified."
Ending_Nina_Default_02,"Her paranoia didn't fade after boarding the shuttle as she predicted. Nina's muscles remained tense as it felt like everyone was watching her... like they were all her enemies. She tried to shrug off these notions, knowing it was just her father's voice rattling around in her head. However, it was the only voice Nina knew."
Ending_Nina_Default_03,"The others' lives seemed dramatically altered by their time on Titan, but Nina was still the same broken Nina. "
Ending_Nina_SQ_01,"Nina was on edge almost every day on Titan. She'd wake up and think, 'Today could be my last,' before putting on her uniform and securing Camp Huygen. With the introduction of killer diseases and monsters in the mines, Nina's emotions proved to be entirely justified. "
Ending_Nina_SQ_02,"But after experiencing just a night orchestrated by {PlayerFullName} where Nina didn't feel fear or paranoia, her spirit was ready to move forward. Her father's destructive lessons had no more power over Nina, and she could disregard them going forward."
Ending_Nina_SQ_03,"While it was likely a small event for everyone else involved, Nina was changed on Titan, and she couldn't wait to see what other walls she could break down back on Earth."

Ending_Octavio_Default_01,"Octavio was known for his partying ways, throwing caution to the wind, and living in the now. No one knew his boisterous nature only existed to bury the guilt he felt inside. He did terrible things on Earth, which was why he left, and Octavio would be in danger the moment he returned."
Ending_Octavio_Default_02,"Unable to reconcile his past and without adequate alcohol on the shuttle to drown his sorrows, Octavio didn't make it to Earth alive. The others found his body after he took some pills, but they couldn't revive him."
Ending_Octavio_SQ_01,"Octavio was known for his partying ways, throwing caution to the wind, and living in the now. No one knew his boisterous nature only existed to bury the guilt he felt inside. He did terrible things on Earth, which was why he left, and Octavio would be in danger the moment he returned. "
Ending_Octavio_SQ_02,"With Freyja by his side, however, he had someone to talk to and confide in. Allowing another past his walls let Octavio clear his conscience on the journey to Earth, and he readied himself to reenter his old life. But this time, he wouldn't be alone. "

#,( 퀘스트 성공 or 안함. ) = 0 or 2
Ending_Odette_Deafult_01,"Odette came to Titan for the opportunity to learn and grow but never thought she'd meet a true friend and mentor in Litzi. Earth never felt like much of a home, so she might have been the only one sad to leave the dangerous moon. Never a dull moment on Titan. "
#,( 퀘스트 성공 시 추가 출력. ) = 2
Ending_Odette_Deafult_02,"Wherever Litzi went, Odette would follow. She was Litzi's apprentice, and there was still so much more to learn. "
#,( 퀘스트 진행중으로 게임 끝. ) = 1
Ending_Odette_SQ_01,"It was a bummer that Camp Huygen went to hell before Odette could throw Litzi's party. Fortunately for her, she made sure to pack all the supplies on the airship, and the celebration was a great way to pass the time on the way back to Earth."
Ending_Odette_SQ_02,Odette would continue as the cold-blooded accomplice of anyone she considered a friend. She had finally found her family. 

Ending_Pierre_01,"Pierre felt pride for everything he accomplished at Camp Huygen. Surviving in such a harsh environment took teamwork and togetherness, which turned a group of strangers into a family. There wasn't much to do on the airship, so he sat back, relaxed, and dreamed about what was to come."
Ending_Pierre_02,"He had already started jotting down notes for new inventions to share with his brother once back on Earth. With Judith's help, Pierre knew he'd win the next brotherly competition. "

Ending_Rana_Default_01,"Rana went to Titan, intent on changing the world, but she was the one who changed in the end. Despite her expertise in hydroponics, she found just how little she knew after working with Seoyeon. Their partnership evolved into an engaging career-changing experience and a never-ending bond of love. "
Ending_Rana_Default_02,"Having possession of the seeds recovered from the mines, Rana knew she and Seoyeon would be able to help humanity with all they discovered. "

Ending_Seble_Default_01,"Seble always possessed a hardened spirit, and her time on Titan only proved to push her further inward. She saw many terrifying things down in the mine, but the political infighting within Camp Huygen also left its mark. "
Ending_Seble_Default_02,She'll take her experiences with her on the next job and hope fewer traumatizing moments occur. 
Ending_Seble_SQ_01,"Seble always possessed a hardened spirit, but her time on Titan showed her how to open up. Developing a friendship with her drone, Pyro, made it easier to forge connections with others in her life."
Ending_Seble_SQ_02,"She'll take her experiences to the next job, knowing her friends will have her back there. Seble already has fun times in mind for the future."

Ending_Seoyeon_01,"Seoyeon's mind was a well-oiled machine when it came to her research, but she was a bit out of sorts without her lab or plant samples on the shuttle. Fortunately, Rana was also there to help her keep her sanity. The two spent every second together, just like back on Titan, talking about their work, lives, hopes, and dreams."
Ending_Seoyeon_02,"Alone, Seoyeon had already received numerous commendations and awards throughout her career. But the world wasn't ready for what Seoyeon could accomplish with Rana by her side. "

Ending_Tau_Default_01,"Tau kept to himself after leaving Camp Huygen. No one there was his friend, so why waste his time? Staying quiet in the corner and watching the others bicker made Tau happy."
Ending_Tau_Default_02,"He had a good thing going on Titan, and these people ruined it. Hopefully, he would find another way to pay the bills. "
Ending_Tau_Caught_01,"It hadn't dawned on anyone until after boarding the shuttle, but the group left Tau in his cell back at Camp Huygen. "
Ending_Tau_Caught_02,There's no way he survived. 

Ending_Temir_Deafult_01,"Always the loner, Temir found a cozy corner in the shuttle and kept to himself. His trip to Titan had been a bust. Temir's mining job fell through, and his current thermodynamics project never got off the ground."
Ending_Temir_Deafult_02,"It was sad to think that the world would never see his genius, but this was a reality Temir had to come to terms with."
Ending_Temir_SQ01_01,"Temir would always get lost in his work, so it was good that Litzi grabbed him on their way out of Camp Huygen. Resting on the shuttle, he chuckled to himself. Having friends and the respect of a team was a new experience for him. "
Ending_Temir_SQ01_02,"He would carry this new confidence to the next project. With the help of his friends, Temir's science would hopefully one day change the planet. "
Ending_Temir_SQ02_01,"No one noticed until they were already on the shuttle, but Temir wasn't with the rest of the group. He was so consumed in his latest project to impress Litzi that he missed the airship before it left Camp Huygen. "
Ending_Temir_SQ02_02,The possibility of Temir surviving alone on Titan was next to impossible. 
Ending_Temir_SQ02_03,Poor Temir.

Ending_Ulf_01,"Ulf had lived an aimless life for too long, and hoped Titan would have changed things. Throughout his travels, he had become a jack of all trades, and Ulf was happy to use his skills to help Camp Huygen, but now he needed to walk a new road. "
Ending_Ulf_02,"Would he continue bartending, get back into security systems, or perhaps take Martin up on his offer to meet his spy friends? His decision would have to wait until they made it back to Earth. "

Ending_Ursula_Default_01,"Ursula stayed quiet on Titan, the place she planned as her final resting place. Upon the shuttle, she revealed to the group that she was extremely wealthy and powerful on Earth. She vowed to help hold TECC responsible for everything that transpired on Titan."
Ending_Ursula_Default_02,Taking down a mega-corporation is nigh impossible and requires every weapon available. Ursula was determined to become that weapon for as long as she continued to draw breath.
Ending_Ursula_SQ_01,"{PlayerFullName} took a swig from Ursula's bottle of whiskey in her honor. When they arrive on Earth, efforts will be made to remember her and ensure her company stands the test of time."

Ending_Vinh_01,Vinh came to Titan as a loyal soldier and left the same. She fought worthy foes on Titan but couldn't avoid the frustration of knowing she'd never fight the notable opponents {PlayerFullName} had the opportunity to battle. 
Ending_Vinh_02,"Seeing everything {PlayerFullName} was capable of, she vowed to stick close, especially not that she'd need a new job on Earth. Bodyguard had a nice ring to it."

Ending_Wirat_01,"Cruising toward humanity's homeworld, Wirat meditated on his recent experiences. He witnessed joy, sadness, and feats of teamwork on Titan and, in the end, felt content. Leaving Earth was Wirat's attempt to find spiritual growth outside the Samsara he was used to, but now he was returning home reaffirmed in the Buddhist teachings he followed."
Ending_Wirat_02,He remained quiet in his trance for the majority of the journey. Where would his path take him next?
