#,Main Quest Name: Nano Stone
#,Purpose: Nano stone and its tutorial
#,"Actor: Ida Shahane, Judith Taggart"
#,KeyPrefix: Act02_MQ_NanoStone

#,This triggers when player obtains nano stone for the first time.
#,Nano stone is gem like item where it forms inside evolved enemies. Player can use the item to craft various advanced gears
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Nar_01,(You pick up a shiny stone left behind in the viscera of the monster's body.)
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Player_02,Crystals inside monsters? Maybe Ida and Judith can make sense of this.

#,This triggers after a nanostone has been researched. UI is updated with ward belt slot.
#,Commnucation from Ida telling player that ward belt item can be crafted and various modules can fit into it. It can give player various advantages such as increased resistances and other side effects
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_AI_03,"<color=#FFFF00>Incoming communication from Ida and Judith, {PlayerFullName}.</color>"
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Judith_04,"It took some doing, but we discovered that the crystal you found was a nanobot core at one time. These new phenomena, I'm calling them <color=#66FFCC>NanoStones</color>, are the product of the environmental nanobots mutating alongside the living organisms they affect. Then, when the monster dies, the nanobot cluster crystalizes and dies, as well."
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Ida_05,"On a hunch, Isko and I also ran some tests of our own. It turns out that you can use <color=#66FFCC>NanoStones</color> to strengthen your nanobots to heighten your infection resistance or use new abilities."
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Judith_06,I'm also adding equipment that can hold <color=#66FFCC>NanoStones</color> to your production list options.
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Ida_07,This was a great discovery! Let us know if you find anything else useful. 
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Judith_08,"Keep digging for more <color=#66FFCC>NanoStones</color>, then <color=#FFA500>Research</color> the hell out of them. "
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Nar_09,(Communication ends.)
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Player_10,"Interesting. I've killed a lot of creatures so far, but this is the first <color=#66FFCC>NanoStone</color> I've found. "
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_AI_11,Agreed. I've just concluded my own cursory analysis of Judith and Ida's findings to supplement what we know so far. 
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Player_12,"Good job, Cassini. What did you find?"
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_AI_13,"First, it appears <color=#66FFCC>NanoStones</color> share the same DNA as the monster it comes from, meaning each has the potential to be quite different. It will take some experimentation to unlock each <color=#66FFCC>NanoStone</color>'s true capabilities."
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_AI_14,"Secondly, the DNA also shows that <color=#66FFCC>NanoStones</color> are linked to humanoid creatures. You are less likely to find <color=#66FFCC>NanoStones</color> inside non-humanoid organisms. "
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_AI_15,"Unfortunately, I cannot detect which creatures possess <color=#66FFCC>NanoStones</color> preemptively, so acquiring them will be a game of chance. "
Act02_MQ_NanoStone_Player_16,"Well... let's play on, then. "
