#,Key Fix: Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection
#,This even triggers when player receives some nano infection damage and they are over the first trait limit.

#,AI detects the nano infection. (Trait popping up in UI).
#,Player sends message to Ida with some data about the infection.
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Player_01,Argh! What is that feeling?
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Nar_02,"(A strange dark energy courses through your veins, which glow green through your skin. It hurts, but only to a small degree for the moment.)"
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_AI_03,"Incoming communication from Ida, {PlayerFullName}."
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Ida_04,"I've been remotely monitoring your vitals, and they just went through the roof. What's happening down there?"
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Player_05,"I got hit by a monster, and it now feels like my body is attacking itself. I thought you said my nanobots resisted that."
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Ida_06,"Your nanobots keep the environmental nanobots from infecting you, but breakthrough Nano Infection through direct contact with mutated creatures is possible."
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Ida_07,"Even with low Nano Infection levels, you're still in danger. They are programmed to self-replicate and will eventually overwhelm your body if we don't take care of this."
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Player_08,What can we do about this? It hurts pretty badly. 
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Ida_09,"Isko and I are already working on a solution. Come back to camp ASAP, so we can address this. "
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Player_10,"Okay, I'm on the way now."

#,"After returning to Ida, player is able to obtain craft recipe for anti-nano bot shots. Only talk to Ida to reduce making unnecessary scene teleport transition."
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Player_11,"I have returned, is there any news about my nanobot infection problem?"
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Ida_12,"As matter of fact I do! I've made Anti-Nanobot Shots available to produce. Using this item decreases your Nano Infection instantly. It is the only defense we currently have for you against the harmful effects at the moment."
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Ida_13,"Please, take this sample for now. Isko and I can produce more if we have enough materials."
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Ida_14,"This breakthrough should make your time underground a lot less painful. Unless you don't like needles."
Event_Tutorial_NanoInfection_Ida_15,"Pack these shots if you think you'll be in contact with Nano Infection, and I'll let you know if I come up with any other solutions. Good luck!"
