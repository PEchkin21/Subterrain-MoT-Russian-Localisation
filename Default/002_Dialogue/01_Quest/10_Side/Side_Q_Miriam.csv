#,Quest Name: Rat Traps 
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_RatTraps

#,Player receives message from Miriam
Side_Q_RatTraps_AI_01,"Incoming message from Miriam, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_02,I need your help. The rats are back! Eek!\n-Miriam Katz-

#,When player speaks with Miriam
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_03,"Miriam, is everything okay?"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_04,"I wish I could say yes. The rats are back, and this time they're bigger and foaming at the mouth. I didn't know who else to call. Can you help, please?"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_05,Certainly! I'll go down there right now and collect some more rat tails for you. 
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_06,Wait... but what if they come back after that? And what if they are even stronger that time too! And what if they are eventually so powerful that they overtake us?! And what if...
Side_Q_RatTraps_AI_07,"{PlayerFullName} , she is having a panic attack. The rats' presence seems to be affecting her on a deeper level. "
Side_Q_RatTraps_Nar_08,(You grab Miriam's hand and lower your speaking tone in hopes of calming her down.)
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_09,Okay... okay... let's breathe... In... out... alright...
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_10,How would you like me to take care of the rats? I'm open to any ideas.
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_11,What about setting traps? That works on normal rats.
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_12,"They'd have to be some pretty big traps for these creatures, right?"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_13,"Yes, but it's the only way to truly keep them away. Please... can you do it? I need you to do it. "
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_14,"I'll see what I can make happen for you. Until then, stay out of the pub basement."
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_15,"I have no intention of going near it, so okay."
Side_Q_RatTraps_AI_16,"Judith may be able to assist with this, {PlayerFullName}. We should see her right away."

#,When player speaks to Miriam before completing side quest
#,"Until quest is done, Miriam does not enter the pub"
#,Replaces Basic_Miriam until end of quest
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_17,I can still hear the rats scratching... did you get those traps?

#,"When player speaks with Judith, after speaking with Miriam "
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_18,"Hey Judith, do you make traps?"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Judith_19,"Don't get that request much, but I've designed heaps of different types. Shrapnel, fire, concussive, what do you need?"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_20,What about a big one?
Side_Q_RatTraps_Judith_21,Big? How big are we talking?
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_22,BIG-big... like a REALLY big trap for some giant rats. 
Side_Q_RatTraps_Judith_23,"Intriguing, and totally doable. Give me a moment. "
Side_Q_RatTraps_Nar_24,"(Judith grabs a pen and starts quickly sketching out a blueprint. It's interesting to watch her at work. After a few minutes, she smiles to herself and gives you the plans.)"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Judith_25,Something like that?
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_26,Wow! This is perfect! I forget sometimes that you're a genius. 
Side_Q_RatTraps_Judith_27,"Stop, you're making my cheeks red. That trap should also be ready to produce as long as you have the materials for it. "
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_28,Thanks! I'll get out of your hair.

#,"Player needs to produce at 3 traps for this quest, but they can produce more for their own purposes as well. "
#,"Once they have 3 traps in their inventory, they can enter the pub basement again. As Miriam said, there are more rats down there, stronger and deadlier than before. The player must defeat them first."
#,"Afterward, there are 3 holes in the basement walls. Player must place a trap in front of each one, and this keeps the rats out for good. "
#,When entering the pub basement
Side_Q_RatTraps_AI_29,Miriam was right... these rats have experienced a more advanced form of mutation and have gone feral.
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_30,"We'll need to get rid of them first, and then we can place traps. Let's get to it!"

#,Once traps are placed
Side_Q_RatTraps_AI_31,"Good job, {PlayerFullName}. We should let Miriam know it's safe to return. "

#,When player speaks to Miriam again
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_32_00,Hey Miriam-
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_32,-Did you get rid of the rats?!
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_33,"It's taken care of, Miriam. You can return to work and be confident that you're safe. "
Side_Q_RatTraps_Nar_34,"(Miriam wraps her arms around you and delivers a tight bear hug, almost making it hard to breathe. You would never have expected this level of strength in her tiny body.)"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_35,I can't tell you what this means! I owe you so much!
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_36,Here's what I have to give you. I hope it's enough. 
Side_Q_RatTraps_Nar_37,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>' and '<color=#66FFCC>Food</color>'.)"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Player_38,"I would have helped for free, seriously. If you need help again, just let me know.  "
Side_Q_RatTraps_Miriam_39,"Of course, I will. I'm off to the pub. Hope to see you there!"
Side_Q_RatTraps_Nar_40,(She gives you another hug before you part ways.)
