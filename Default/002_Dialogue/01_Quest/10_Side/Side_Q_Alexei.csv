#,When player speaks to Alexei
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Alexei_03,"Good to see you, Wolf. It was a beautiful thing to fight beside you at the mine elevator, despite the unfortunate circumstances that brought us there."
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Player_04,"I'm just glad we survived, but can I ask... Why do you keep calling me Wolf?"
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Alexei_05,"From the second our eyes met, I knew we were kindred spirits. The heart of a hunter lies within each of us, even if you still need to awaken yours. "
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Player_06,You really think so?
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Alexei_07,"I know so... and I'm here to help you do just that. Wolves must hunt, and we bore quickly after hunting the same prey day after day. Making all other creatures your prey makes you the apex predator. "
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Alexei_08,"My challenge is this... find and defeat every kind of creature on Titan. If you can do that, your wolf spirit will be sated."
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Player_09,"Consider your challenge accepted, Alexei. Honestly, it sounds kind of fun. "
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Alexei_10,"Good, good... I'm syncing with your Omniscope to keep tabs on your progress. Even if I can't go with you into the mines, we are on this journey together, Wolf. "
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Alexei_11,"'Live like the wolf, howl like the wolf.'"
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Player_12,"'Live like the wolf, howl like the wolf.'"
Side_Q_BecomeTheWolf_Alexei_13,*hehe* Good hunting.
