#,Quest Name: Passing Notes
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_PassingNotes

#,"Octavio asks for the player's help to romantically court Freyja. The player gets to choose how this goes to an extent, through 2 major choices. There are 6 endings for this scenario. Here they are ranked best to worst in terms of rewards/outcome:"
#,"Choice 2, then Choice 1 = Best ending 1, player gets XP, credits, and Lover's Grip, everyone's happy"
#,"Choice 2, then Choice 3 = Best Ending 2, Player gets XP from Octavio, then either Lover's Armor or Craft Materials from Freyja, Octavio hates you though"
#,"Choice 1, then Choice 1 = Positive ending, player gets XP and Lover's Grip, everyone's happy"
#,"Choice 2, then Choice 2 = Negative ending, player gets XP, craft materials, and credits, everyone's sad, but no one hates you"
#,"Choice 1, then Choice 3 = Worst Ending 2, Player only gets XP, Octavio hates you"
#,"Choice 1, then Choice 2 = Worst Ending 1, Player only gets XP, everyone hates you"

#,Player receives a message to start quest
Side_Q_PassingNotes_AI_01,"Incoming message from Octavio, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_02,"I need some advice, and you seem like just the person to ask. Come by when you're free, please.\n-Octavio Cardoso-"

#,When player talks to Octavio
#,We just need the player dialogue choice here to initiate the talking about the quest.
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_03_00_Player,"What's up, Octavio? I got your message. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_03,"Hey, you're just the person I wanted to talk to. This is urgent!"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_04,"Certainly! What's the emergency? Monsters? Leaks? This doesn't involve rat tails, does it?"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_05,None of that... You see... I am in love.
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_06,That doesn't sound very urgent.
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_07,Love is the most urgent of emergencies! When your heart beats so fast you think you'll faint? When butterflies in your stomach try to escape? When your tongue can't keep up with the torrent of words your brain wants to say?
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_08,Have you talked with Doctor Shahane about that? Maybe you're having a heart attack?
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_09,"No, this is definitely love... but I don't know how to pursue this feeling. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_10,"You don't strike me as the shy type, Octavio. So, what's the deal?"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_11,"Well, I've been a playboy my whole life, but the one I love is... Freyja. She is so incredibly beautiful, but also very serious. I don't think she'd ever accept me, and that frightens me. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_12,Have you tried just talking to her?
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_13,"Every time I try, my words come out wrong. I wrote down my feelings though... a poem of sorts. Could you deliver this note to her? If she read this, then I'm sure it'll convince her I'm for real. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_14,"Uh, sure. I'll give it to her if I see her."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_15,I'll leave you to it then. Thank you!

#,----------------------------------------------------

#,When player talks to Octavio again before delivering note to Freyja
#,Replaced Basic_Octavio until end of quest
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_16,Have you given Freyja my note yet?

#,Player talks to Freyja
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_17,"Hi, Freyja. I have a note for you from Octavio. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Freyja_18,"Octavio? I don't really know him, so what could this be about?"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_19,It's better if you just read it. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Nar_20,"(You give the note to Freyja, and she reads through it quickly. With a confused expression on her face, she looks to you.)"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Freyja_21,"It says he has a thing for me. That's kind of odd, though. He's barely spoken more than a sentence to me before today."

#,Player choice to give positive or negative response to Freyja
#,Positive choices will lead to them getting together
#,"Negative choices may ensure they never get together, and opens up chance for player to pursue Freyja instead"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Freyja_22,"Why do you think that is, {PlayerFullName}?"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S01,"He really likes you, so he probably just gets flustered when you're around."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S02,He probably didn't even notice you.

#,If player chooses Positive response
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S01_Freyja_01,"Wow! That's incredibly sweet. Octavio is quite handsome, so I'll definitely consider this. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S01_Nar_02,(Freyja flips the note over and writes something. She then hands it to you.)
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S01_Freyja_03,"Okay, could you give this note back to him? He'll like it. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S01_Player_04,Certainly. 

#,If player chooses negative response
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S02_Freyja_01,Oh? Well... maybe he could explain himself if we met face to face.
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S02_Nar_02,(Freyja flips the note over and writes something. She then hands it to you.)
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S02_Freyja_03,Can you give this to Octavio? That would be very helpful. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note1_S02_Player_04,Of course. 

#,[ Need Text ]----------------------------------------

#,When player returns to Octavio
#,"Here again, we need the player dialogue choice here to initiate the talking about the quest."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_23_00,I just talked to Freyja. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_23,Did you give her the note? Did she smile when she read it? Tell me everything!
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_24,"I did as you asked, yes. She even wrote you back. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_25,"Oh, let me see it!"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Nar_26,(You give Octavio the note from Freyja. His eyes move back and forth at lightning speed.)
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_27,"So, it says she's willing to meet in the backroom of the <color=#FFFF00>Supply Depot</color> tonight to hear more."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_28,"Good, then it sounds like you don't need me anymore. I'll just be on my-"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Octavio_29,"-Wait, there's no time written here. Can you go back and tell Freyja I'll be there at 8pm tonight? Please!"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_30,*Sigh* Sure... I'll go tell her. 

#,----------------------------------------------------

#,Player returns to Freyja - Added text for Freyja as well
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Freyja_31_Player_01,"Hey, Freyja. I'm back! "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Freyja_31,"I wasn't expecting to see you again so soon, {PlayerFullName}. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Player_32,"Yeah, there was something else I needed to tell you."

#,"Player second choice, now with 3 choices: Positive, negative, and selfish choice"
#,Note: selfish choice only available if player has not already made Nina their girlfriend
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Freyja_33,Oh? What did you need to tell me?
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01,Octavio wants to meet at 8pm tonight.
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02,Octavio doesn't want to meet with you after all. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S03,Forget Octavio! I want to take you out.

#,Player chooses Note2_S01 after selecting Note1_S01 = 2 positives
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_Freyja_01,I can't believe I forgot to set a time. Thanks for following up. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_Freyja_02,Tell Octavio I can't wait to see him at 8pm tonight. I'm very excited!
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_Player_03,I'll let him know. Hope you have fun! 

#,Return to Octavio after 2 positives
#,Player receives Lover's Grip and XP
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_Player_04,"Everything's set for 8pm tonight, Octavio!"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_Octavio_05,"Thank you, {PlayerFullName}! Tonight wouldn't be possible without you. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_Octavio_06,I'm going to go get ready. Bye!

#,"After X turns, player receives this message. "
#,Player receives XP and Lover's Grip if they choose this ending.
#,"If player has not yet completed Game Night SQ, Octavio will automatically say YES to the player's request to attend. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_AI_07,"Incoming message from Octavio, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_Octavio_08,"Freyja and I had an amazing night, and she even agreed to be my girlfriend! Your help has been life-changing! I'm putting a gift in the supply crate for you as a token of my appreciation. Well, our appreciation! See you later!\n-Octavio Cardoso."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_1_Nar_09,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Lover's Grip</color>'.)"

#,"Player chooses Note2_S01 after selecting Note1_S02 = 1 negative, then 1 positive"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_Freyja_01,"Maybe I was wrong about Octavio. He's always seemed so flighty, but if he caught the fact I forgot to set a time, then maybe there's more to the man."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_Freyja_02,Tell Octavio I can't wait to see him at 8pm tonight. I'm even more curious to hear him out now.
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_Player_03,I'll let him know. 

#,Return to Octavio after 1 negative then 1 positive
#,"Player receives Lover's Grip, credits, and XP"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_Player_04,Freyja knows the time now. She'll meet you at 8pm tonight.
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_Octavio_05,"Thank you, {PlayerFullName}! I'm nervous about tonight, but I wouldn't have this chance without your help."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_Octavio_06,I'm going to go get ready. I can't mess this up. See you later. 

#,"After X turns, player receives this message. "
#,"Player receives XP, credits, and Lover's Grip if they choose this ending."
#,"If player has not yet completed Game Night SQ, Octavio will automatically say yes to the player's request to attend. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_AI_07,"Incoming message from Octavio, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_Octavio_08,"Freyja and I had a great night. It was rocky at first, but we worked through it and even have a second date lined up. I know I asked a lot of you, so I'm putting a gift in the supply crate for you as a token of my appreciation. Thanks so much, and we'll speak soon.\n-Octavio Cardoso.-"
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S01_2_Nar_09,(You received '<color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>' and '<color=#66FFCC>Lover's Grip</color>'.)

#,"Player chooses Note2_S02 after Note1_S01 = 1 positive, then 1 negative"
#,"Choosing this option means Freyja goes directly to Octavio herself. No Need for player to return to him, as he'll get a message. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_1_Freyja_01,Oh no! I knew I came off too eager. That must have turned him off. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_1_Player_02,It's also a possibility that he just doesn't like you as much as you thought. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_1_Freyja_03,"I don't know... something seems suspicious about this. His note was so nice, and I'd hate to think I scared him off. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_1_Freyja_04,I should talk to him directly. Thanks for telling me about Octavio. 

#,Choosing positive and then negative options means Freyja goes directly to Octavio herself. There is no need for player to return to him.
#,"After X turns, player receives this message. "
#,Player only receives XP if they choose this ending.
#,"If player has not yet completed Game Night SQ, Octavio will automatically say no to the player's request to attend. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_1_AI_05,"Incoming message from Octavio, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_1_Octavio_06,"I just spoke with Freyja, and she told me what you said about me. Why did you double-cross me like that? It doesn't matter. I hope you never find love.\n-Octavio Cardoso."

#,Player chooses Note2_S02 after Note1_S02 = 2 negatives
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Freyja_01,Why did he even send me a note to begin with then? That Octavio is one cold-hearted bastard.
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Player_02,"He loves to stir up drama is all, and he dragged you and me into it this time."
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Freyja_03,Not me... Not anymore. You can tell him I never want to speak to him again. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Freyja_04,Or don't tell him. It makes no difference to me. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Player_05,"Message received. Have a good one, Freyja. "

#,Return to Octavio after 2 negatives
#,"Player receives craft materials, credits, and XP. No lover's grip if they don't go on a date. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Player_06,"Hey, Octavio, it looks like she's just not into you. Freyja cancelled your meeting tonight. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Octavio_07,What... why?! I thought I at least had a shot to tell her how I feel. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Player_08,"Nope, she said she's just not into you. Tough break, man. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Octavio_09,I guess it just wasn't meant to be. *Sigh*
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Octavio_10,"Anyway, I know I made you run around for me, so at least take this for the trouble. "
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Nar_11,(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Craft Materials</color>' and '<color=#66FFCC>Credits</color>'.)
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Octavio_12,Now if you'll excuse me... I need to be alone for a bit. 
Side_Q_PassingNotes_Note2_S02_2_Player_13,Sure.
