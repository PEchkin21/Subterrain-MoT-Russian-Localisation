#,Document Outline: Side Quest Dialogue Text

#,Quest NPC: Odette Gauthier
#,Quest Name: Surprise Party 
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_SurpriseParty

#,"Odette wants to throw a surprise party for Litzi because it's her birthday, though she's the only one who knows it. If Odette does it, it'll be too obvious. Player must buy party items from the various stores around camp. Miriam (Cake), Octavio (music), Grace (party favors)."
#,"This quest should trigger after Miriam's quest, but before Octavio's side quest. Player must complete this quest to unlock Fang's quest. "
#,"Suggestion: If we wanted to create extra difficulty, we could create an additional obstacle for the player with Litzi. If they have party supplies in their inventory, maybe they can't come within a certain distance of Litzi or she'll get suspicious. I don't know how that'd work logically, but it could be fun if we wanted to implement that. If you like that, we can add it in Draft2"

#,Player gets message to start quest
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_AI_01,"Incoming message from Odette, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_02,I'm planning something. I'll loop you in when I see you next.\n-Odette Gauthier-

#,When player speaks with Odette
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_03,"You wanted to see me, Odette?"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_04,"Yes. My plan is in its final stages, and your assistance is greatly needed."
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_05,"Litzi's birthday is coming up, and I want to surprise her. It's going to be huge! Food, music, everything, but we have to keep it on the down low. If Litzi gets wind of the party, it'll ruin the surprise. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_06,"If I leave my post and start sneaking around, it'll be too obvious. That's why I need you to collect the party supplies without Litzi seeing you. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_07,"Sounds easy enough, and Litzi is great! Do I get an invite to the party if I help?"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_08,"Yes... duh... okay, so talk to Miriam for a cake, Octavio for the music, and Grace for party favors. When you have them all, I'll hide them until it's party time. Got it?"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_09,Got it! I'll be back. 

#,When player speaks with Odette after starting quest
#,Replaces Basic_Odette until the end of quest
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_10,Got those party supplies yet?

#,Player speaks with Miriam
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_11,"Hey, Miriam! Odette said something about a cake for Litzi?"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Miriam_12,"Oh, definitely! I'm so happy you helped with the rat problem, or else there would be no cake. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Miriam_13,I left the cake waiting for you in the pub's kitchen. Just grab it when you're ready. 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_14,"Great, I'll go get it now. "

#,Speak with Miriam before getting the cake 
#,Replaces Basic_Miriam until player gets the cake
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Miriam_15,Get the cake from the pub kitchen soon. We don't want it to go bad.

#,When player interacts with cake in pub kitchen
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Nar_16,"(The cake is beautiful with layers of coconut and raspberries with blue frosting, Litzi's favorite color.)"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Nar_17,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Birthday Cake</color>'.)"

#,Player speaks to Octavio 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_18,"Hey, Octavio, I'm here for music for Litzi's party. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Octavio_19,"Ask and you shall receive, {PlayerFullName}. I worked all week on the perfect playlist for Litzi. It should pass Odette's approval standards. *haha*"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_20,"Wonderful, should I go pick it up somewhere?"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Octavio_21,"No need! I keep the tunes on me at all times, and what's mine... is now yours. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Nar_22,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Birthday Mixtape</color>'.)"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_23,Thanks! I'll take it to Odette. 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Octavio_24,Have fun!

#,Player speaks with Grace
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_25,"Hey, Grace! Odette sent me to pick up party favors. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Grace_26,"Yup! I created some candy molds shaped like gears, and repurposed some of our chemicals into makeshift glow sticks. This party is going to slay!"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_27,"Wow, that's really creative. I can't wait to see them. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Grace_28,"You're in luck then. I have them hidden in Mine Operations, since Litzi never goes in there. I'll upload a marker to your mini-map. Grab it at your leisure. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_29,I'll head there now. Thanks! 

#,Speak with Grace before getting the party favors 
#,Replaces Basic_Grace until player gets the favors
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Grace_30,Maybe I hid the party favors too well? Go check Mine Operations again.

#,When player interacts with favors in Mine Operations
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Nar_31,"(The favors are everything Grace described. The hard candies are multi-colored gears, and there is a mountain of glow sticks. Very cool!)"
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Nar_32,"(You receive '<color=#66FFCC>Birthday Favors</color>'.)"

#,When player has all party supplies
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_AI_33,"We have everything Odette requested, {PlayerFullName}. We should give them to her before we run into Litzi. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_34,"Good plan, Cassini. "

#,Returning to Odette with all 3 party items.
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_35,I'm back with the party supplies. They are kinda heavy.
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_36,"Looks like I owe you one. I wasn't sure you were going to come through, but you absolutely did. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_37,Here are some credits for all the running around. I also have something else...
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Player_38,What is it?
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_39,I was working with Pierre and designed a new device that would make a killer present for Litzi.
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_40,"On the other hand, I know it would also be helpful for you underground. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_41,"I wish we could make a second one, but we just don't have the parts. So, I'll leave the choice to you.."
 
#,Player choice to take present for self or give it to Litzi
#,"If player wants it, it's the Surprise Glove. If player gives it to Litzi, she becomes Efficient "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Odette_42,I call it the Surprise Glove. What should we do with it?
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S01,It sounds perfect for Litzi. It should be a present for her. 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S02,"If it'll help underground, I'll take it. "

#,Player chooses to give glove to Litzi. Player gets credits and Litzi becomes efficient 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S01_Odette_01,"You sure? Well, I know Litzi will love the glove too. She always works harder after getting a good gift, so this might increase Power production. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S01_Player_02,She deserves it. Litzi is awesome. 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S01_Odette_03,You're not wrong. I'll let you know when it's time to pull the trigger on the surprise party. You're definitely invited. 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S01_Player_04,I'll be waiting. Later!

#,Player chooses to take the glove. They receive credits and glove. 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S02_Odette_01,"That's what I was thinking too, so here you go. Litzi's not the kind to need presents anyway. You'll make better use of it. "
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S02_Odette_02,I'll let you know when it's time to pull the trigger on the surprise party. You're definitely invited. 
Side_Q_SurpriseParty_Glove_S02_Player_03,I'll be waiting. Later!
