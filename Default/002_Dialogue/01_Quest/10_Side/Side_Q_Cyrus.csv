#,Quest NPC: Cyrus
#,Quest Name: Take to the Air 
#,Key_Fix: Side_Q_TakeToTheAir

#,"He's always been obsessed with flight, and has researched gravity. player must ask for Judith's help and collect the necessary materials to complete an anti-gravity device. For Cyrus, it provides the feeling of weightlessness he misses.  "

#,Player gets message to start quest
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_AI_01,"Incoming message from Cyrus, {PlayerFullName}."
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_02,I had a dream last night and would like to share it with you if you get a moment.\n-Cyrus-

#,When player speaks to Cyrus
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_03_00,Cyrus? Earth to Cyrus...
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_03,Oh... hey {PlayerFullName}... Sorry I was lost in thought. 
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_04,"Daydreaming on the job, huh?"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_05,"Here and there, yes. Remember when I told you I'm a pilot? Well, I'm much more than that."
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_06,"I'm actually a phenomenal pilot, one of the best... and I had a dream last night that I was controlling an Epsilon Mark VI flying through a city and zooming past the other crafts."
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_07,"...and I miss it. I'm a pilot without a craft. I haven't felt weightless in months, and it hurt my soul to strip the airship for parts to the point where it may never fly again."
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_08,There are a lot of things from my past that I miss too. Is there anything I can do?
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_09,"Who knows? Maybe Titan is our final destination. Maybe all we have now are our dreams, tak?"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_10,"I'd like to think we have a bright future, all of us. In any case, I'll see you later. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_11,"Yeah, see you later."

#,After stepping a few steps away from Cyrus. 
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_12,"Cyrus looks bad, Cassini. Any idea how we could help him?"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_AI_13,"Without a medical scan, I cannot suggest medications. He did, however, mention that he misses the feeling of weightlessness. Maybe a technological solution?"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_14,Let's see if Judith can help come up with something.

#,Player speaks with Cyrus before finishing quest
#,Replaces Basic_Cyrus until end of quest
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_15,I wonder if I'll ever fly again...

#,Player speaks with Judith (Pierre comes in afterward)
#,"I picture this side quest requiring less craft materials (maybe 25% less) if player has already completed Pierre's quest, since he's not preoccupied by his own project. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_16,"Hey, Judith, I need your help. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_17,"For you, anything. What's the deal?"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_18,"I just talked with Cyrus, and he's battling some major depression. He misses the feeling of flight and it's got him down. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_19,"So, the idea of designing some sort of device for Cyrus to make him weightless came up, and you're the one to ask for off-the-wall stuff like that. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_20,"As much as I love Cyrus, that kind of anti-gravity tech requires heaps of craft materials and would take weeks for me to design. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_21,"Hmmm, that's unfortunate. He's not in a good headspace right now, and I want to help him. "

#,If player has NOT completed Pierre's side quest
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Nar_22,"(Pierre enters the room, quickly putting a device in his pocket.)"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Pierre_23,"Sorry, I was listening from the other room. There's a lot on my plate, but I could probably help out. Cyrus is a friend, and we should do all we can. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_24,That's great! Is it possible now that Pierre's helping too?
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_25,"Yes... but it'll take some time and, like I said, heaps and heaps of craft materials. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Pierre_26,"If you get the parts, though, Judith and I can knock out the design. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_27,"I already have a few ideas, actually. Come back when you have the materials, and we'll jump on it here. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_28,Got it! I'll head out. 

#,If player ALREADY completed Pierre's side quest
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Nar_29,"(Pierre enters the room, patting you on the back with a smile.)"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Pierre_30,"Sorry, I was listening from the other room. I've finished the majority of my personal projects, so I'd love to help out. Cyrus is a friend, and we should do all we can. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_31,That's great! Is it possible now that Pierre's helping too?
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_32,"With his full attention on this project, it makes it easier, yes. Still going to need heaps and heaps of craft materials, though. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Pierre_33,"If you get the parts, Judith and I can knock out the design."
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_34,"I already have a few ideas, actually. Come back when you have the materials, and we'll jump on it here. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_35,Got it! I'll head out. 

#,When player has enough craft materials and returns to Judith after at least X turns (enough turns to work out the design with Pierre).
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_36_00,I'm back! Do you have the design ready?
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_36,Depends... Do you have the parts?
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_37,Yes. Here you go!
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_38,"Oh good! I'll take those. Now, meet me with Cyrus in my workshop for the unveiling."
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_39,"Cassini, can you send Cyrus a message to go to Engineering?"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_AI_40,Yes. I'll make it convincing. 

#,"Fade in on Engineering. Player, Judith, and Pierre are circled around Cyrus. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_41,The message I got was vague. Is anyone gonna tell me what this is about?
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_42,"We have a surprise for you. Judith, can you explain?"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_43,"Yes!  So, at first we were going to make a whole chamber which would have cost tons of credits and taken months. Pierre had the idea to miniaturize the experience. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_44,Wait... a what now?
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Pierre_45,"Using a combination of magnetism and air pressure, these pocket-sized disks we've invented, and patented by the way, can make a target float for a short time. See?"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Nar_46,"(Pierre presses a button on the disk to energize it and then throws it at Cyrus's feet. Within seconds, he is hoisted into the air hovering over everyone and almost touching the ceiling.)"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_47,Wooohooooo!
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Nar_48,"(For the first time in a while... Cyrus is smiling and laughing. Eventually, he is lowered again.)"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_49,That was incredible! I thought I'd never feel it again!
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_50,"When you told me you missed it, we worked hard to give you the gift of flight again, because we care about you. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Pierre_51,"And you can take some of these disks with you, Cyrus, in case you feel the urge again."
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_52,Keep that smile going. 
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Cyrus_53,"Thank you, everyone. I'm going to use another as soon as I get back to the hangar. Later. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Nar_54,"(Cyrus leaves, beaming over the experience of flight once more.)"
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_55,"You did a good thing here, {PlayerFullName}. I'm sending you the plans for these Anti-Gravity Disks, as well. They should be pretty helpful underground. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Pierre_56,"They don't last long, as you've seen, but may be useful in a pinch. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Player_57,"I'll take the plans, for sure. I'm just happy to see Cyrus smile again. "
Side_Q_TakeToTheAir_Judith_58,Us too. We'll see you later.
