#,Main Quest Name: Assembly02
#,Object: Terminal Data Log
#,Purpose: Main story push.
#,"Actor: Judith Taggart, Pierre Ondo, Ida Shahane"
#,KeyPrefix: Act02_MQ_26

#,Player takes device found in the control center scene to Judith.
Act02_MQ_26_Player_01,"Judith, can you retrieve the data from this device?"
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_02,"(Judith takes the device, lowers her microscopic lens, and gets in for a closer examination.)"
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_03,"Anything's possible. It'll be easier when I know what this is, though."
Act02_MQ_26_Player_04,"Cassini says it's an old <color=#66FFCC>TECC Log</color>, so the data is pretty critical. "
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_05,"Well, that's a horse of a different color, for sure. <b>Pierre, come quick!</b>"
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_06,(Pierre rushes in.)
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_07,"What's up, Judith?"
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_08,"You're the computer expert, so see what you make of this."
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_09,(Pierre takes a small portable device and connects it to the datalog.)
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_10,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_11,"Yeah... This is a fascinating build, but most of the data is unrecoverable. But I found something.. Oh? TECC Second in command, Mark Miller?"
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_12,"(Pierre stares at the device, and a grim look appears on his face.)"
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_13,We should bring Ida in on this. She'll be interested in anything pertaining to the previous settlers.
Act02_MQ_26_Player_14,"Of course. Cassini... send a message to Ida, please. "
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_15,(...)
Act02_MQ_26_AI_16,"<color=#FFFF00>Message sent, {PlayerFullName}.</color>"
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_17,"While we wait, tell us exactly what's going on?"
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_18,"I am not 100% on this yet. I'll let you know when I can recover and interpret more data, though. That's where Ida will be most helpful."
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_19,Please tell her to see me when she arrives. 
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_20,(Pierre takes the device to the other room to continue his work.)

#,Fade Out
#,Fade In. Ida enters.
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_21,"(After a while, Ida finally finds you.)"
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_22,I dropped everything and rushed here. I need to see whatever you've found on the previous settlers!
Act02_MQ_26_Player_23,"Pierre has a lead, Ida, but he said he needs your help before anything's concrete. "
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_24,Follow me to my workshop.
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_25,(Everyone follows Judith to the workshop.)

#,Everyone enters workshop in the engineering.
#,"Inside workshop, Pierre is busy working on the device."
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_26,"You have great timing. I managed to recover 73% of the available data. Take a look, Ida."
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_27,"(The screen displays detailed images of various human limbs, organs, and each part's associated DNA. Pierre presses a few keys, and suddenly, what was once human is mutated into horrifying configurations... into monsters. Ida is stunned.)"
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_28,What in the world... Is that even possible?
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_29,"I see what I'm seeing, but can somebody please explain what I'm seeing?"
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_30,"Yes... When the first TECC explorers came to Titan, it was far from hospitable to humans. The surface had yet to be terraformed, so it was essentially a barren rock compared to what we have today. TECC's plan was to use two kinds of nanobots."
Act02_MQ_26_Player_31,I remember. TECC injected one type of nanobot into the workers and used another industrial nanobot to terraform the atmosphere.
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_32,I only received a small cluster of immunization nanobots.
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_33,Same.
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_34,"That's because Titan was already mostly habitable for us this time around, within reason."
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_35,"Regardless, if this data is correct, the atmospheric nanobots somehow malfunctioned. After terraforming the environment was complete, they didn't stop. The nanobots moved on to altering any living organisms they found, including people."
Act02_MQ_26_Player_36,So all those monsters down in the mine?
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_37,Yes... they <color=#FFFF00>ARE</color> the previous settlers.
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_38,What about our miners who got sick underground? Are they going to become monsters?
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_39,"The contamination may be caused by the same environmental nanobots, but our miners aren't mutating due to the difference in our nanobot tech. They either fall ill or succumb to the sickness. "
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_40,"And that applies to everyone except {PlayerFullName}, who has limited resistance."
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_41,Are you saying that we could turn into monsters as well?
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_42,"Theoretically, yes. To be honest, nothing is stopping the environmental nanobots from attacking us too."
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_43,Then why are we still alive?
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_44,That was something else I found.
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_45,"(Pierre changes the screen to a readout of the camp and the various mining levels, listing each one by number.)"
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_46,"I can't explain why, but all of the environmental nanobots are in the mine, almost like they are choosing to stay there. Like they... live there. Checking their historical trajectory, the nanobots moved underground shortly before we arrived and established Camp Huygen."
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_47,Wait... Wait... Wait wait wait wait wait...
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_48,"(Everyone looks to Judith, who seems more agitated than the rest.)"
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_49,"Is it just me, or does this suggest some kind of intelligence on the part of the nanobots? Are they becoming sentient?"
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_50,"There's no way of knowing, but we should be careful going forward if we're dealing with an unfriendly artificial intelligence. "
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_51,I don't see any going forward here. There's only really one choice.
Act02_MQ_26_Player_52,What's that?
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_53,"We pack up, get to HQ, and find a way back to Earth. <color=#FFFF00>Titan is beyond saving</color>, and it will only get more dangerous. If we stay, it will inevitably kill us."
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_54,"On that note, I found something else that might help us there, too. Schematics show an underground <color=#FFFF00>Supply Train</color> on level 7, possibly connected to TECC HQ. It would be much safer than attempting to hoof it."
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_55,Except that it spells instant death for anyone but {PlayerFullName}.
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_56,"Right, but it's also too much of an ask for us to uproot everything and take the journey on foot. The <color=#FFFF00>TECC Airship</color> is a potential vehicle for everyone to leave, but it's been out of commission for what seems like forever."
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_57,"And, of course, we don't know HQ's current status or why it cut off communication in the first place."
Act02_MQ_26_Player_58,"Then why don't I make my way to the train, scout it out, and see if it's even usable."
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_59,"Splendid idea, {PlayerFullName}!"
Act02_MQ_26_Judith_60,"Agreed. And once you find the train, message me because it's likely not in working order. Should be easy to fix, though."
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_61,"You should also talk to Cyrus in the garage. The airship needs heavy repairs since it was stripped for parts to keep the camp going, but Cyrus is clever. He'll know how to fix it. If the two of you put your heads together and get it running, then you don't have to go to HQ alone."
Act02_MQ_26_Player_62,"It's worth looking into, at least.  <color=#FFFF00>Supply Train</color> by myself or together on the  <color=#FFFF00>TECC Airship.</color>"
Act02_MQ_26_Ida_63,"Great! Then I am... going to relay all of this to the other department leaders in person. No mass messages since we don't want to cause panic, but we should also start deciding what to pack and what we're leaving behind. "
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_64,(The gathering adjourns as Ida leaves and Judith returns to work. Pierre approaches with a keycard.)
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_65,"Take this keycard. I've transferred all permissions from Mark Miller to this card, so it should open just about any TECC door you encounter. "
Act02_MQ_26_Pierre_66,"Hey, good luck. Whatever you choose, airship or train, we have your back. "
Act02_MQ_26_Nar_67,(Pierre hands over <color=#66FFCC>Keycard: TECC Master</color> and returns to his work.)
