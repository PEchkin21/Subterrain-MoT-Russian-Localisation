#,Main Quest Name: Meets AI at HQ
#,"Actor: Player, AI"
#,KeyPrefix: Act04_MQ_70

#,After AI's prototype Titanian comes out
Act04_MQ_70_TECCAI_01,<b>Behold your undoing... The Titanian!</b>
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_02,"(The machine of death whirs as its limbs unfold. It lurches forward and sets its gaze of multiple eyes upon you. You have been marked as the enemy, but you hold your composure.)"
Act04_MQ_70_Player_03,A fancy name for something about to be a pile of trash. 
Act04_MQ_70_TECCAI_04,"On the contrary, the Titanian is a prototype designed to fight the alien if you proved... difficult. It is forged from millions of nanobots that destroy clusters outside its own. In other words..."
Act04_MQ_70_TECCAI_05,Any advantage you previously gained from your nanobots is useless against The Titanian.
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_06,"(What the AI says seems true. Your body actively rejects the Titanian's presence. Everything in you tells you to run, but there's nowhere to go. You either fight or die.)"
Act04_MQ_70_TECCAI_07,Titanian! Attack!

#,"When Boss04 reaches 50% HP, it switches to V2."
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_08,"(The Titanian is moving slower, and you have the upper hand until...)"
Act04_MQ_70_TECCAI_09,I underestimated you... but I cannot let you win. Humanity's existence is at stake! 
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_10,"(The AI's red eyes go dim, and the whole room shakes as the mainframe processes a truly complicated command.)"
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_11,"(Suddenly... The Titanian's eyes shine red, and the AI's voice now comes from the prototype.)"
Act04_MQ_70_TECCAI_12,Assuming control. This will be your final resting place.
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_13,<color=#FFFF00>(The AI has downloaded itself into the Titanian. Defeating it could mean destroying the AI for good.)</color>
Act04_MQ_70_Player_14,You won't win this battle!

#,"After defeating AI's prototype. Player is given choice to leave the Titan, or face Boss 5"
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_15,"(The room goes dark before emergency power kicks in. The AI within The Titanian has been defeated, and you breathe a heavy sigh of relief...)"
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_16,"(Until another explosion rocks TECC HQ, knocking you off-balance momentarily. Then your Omniscope suddenly shocks you again. Could this mean...?)"
Act04_MQ_70_Player_17,Cassini? Are you back?
Act04_MQ_70_AI_18,Yes. The TECC AI's suppression has been removed. 
Act04_MQ_70_Player_19,"Just in time too. We're between a rock and a hard place, and I need some options."
Act04_MQ_70_AI_20,"I have accessed security data, and what I have found is alarming. The alien is indeed on its way to the nanobot chamber."
Act04_MQ_70_Player_21,Can we win against that thing?
Act04_MQ_70_AI_22,"Analyzing what we know, there is a 34% chance the alien will self-destruct if allowed to consume unlimited nanobots. This chain reaction may destroy TECC HQ and the alien."
Act04_MQ_70_Player_23,I guess we have another fight ahead of us.
Act04_MQ_70_AI_24,"There is one other choice, though I am reluctant to share it. "
Act04_MQ_70_Player_25,"Go ahead, Cassini. Better to hear it all. "
Act04_MQ_70_AI_26,Okay... Your other option is to <color=#FFFF00>escape to Earth</color>. I can authorize access to the spaceport and a shuttle with enough fuel reserves for a one-way trip.
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_27,"(<b>This is huge!</b> On the one hand, the TECC AI was telling the truth. This alien can potentially end humanity, especially if it reaches Earth. Killing it will be challenging without the aid offered by the AI, but leaving it alive could threaten everything.)"
Act04_MQ_70_Nar_28,"(On the other hand, while a 34% chance is low, the alien could potentially destroy itself and TECC HQ without intervention. You will only be safe if you leave for Earth before that happens.)"

#,Player's choices (two)
#,Choice #2 (Leaving for Earth) will trigger the end sequences.
Act04_MQ_70_AI_29,"How would you like to proceed, {PlayerFullName}?"
Act04_MQ_70_S01,(Battle the Alien Lifeform.)
Act04_MQ_70_S02,(Board Shuttle for Earth.)

#,After Choice #1 (Battle the Alien Life-Form)
Act04_MQ_70_S01_Player_01,We can't leave the job half-done. There's too much at stake.
Act04_MQ_70_S01_Player_02,"I've taken down one monster, leaving just one more to go. "
Act04_MQ_70_S01_AI_03,"This will be the most brutal battle you've ever faced, {PlayerFullName}. It is a creature even the TECC AI could not defeat. "
Act04_MQ_70_S01_Nar_04,"(Another explosion shakes the building, this time even louder and closer. You must act now, or your choice will be made for you.)"
Act04_MQ_70_S01_AI_05,<color=#FFFF00>Make sure you are ready before you enter the nanobot manufacturing chamber</color>. It will be waiting for us.
Act04_MQ_70_S01_Player_06,"Okay... Let's go save humanity, Cassini. "
