Act04_MQ_80_Nar_01,"(The alien hovers above the ground, horrifyingly inhuman in its appearance. The particles of its unstable nanobot body weave in and out, expanding and contracting in size.)"
Act04_MQ_80_Player_02,That's the alien?! I don't even know what I'm looking at! How do I fight this thing?
Act04_MQ_80_Player_03,"Quick, Cassini, what can you tell me?"
Act04_MQ_80_AI_04,"The creature is made up of millions of lifeforms, each one also attached to several nanobots. It is less a single alien and more an alien swarm working together. "
Act04_MQ_80_AI_05,I cannot gather data from the swarm. Detailed analytics are returning with errors.
Act04_MQ_80_Player_06,Will weakening it tell us more?
Act04_MQ_80_AI_07,"Fewer alien-infected nanobots disrupting my scanners would help, yes. "
Act04_MQ_80_Player_08,Let me know when you have something. 
Act04_MQ_80_AI_09,"I will. Good luck, {PlayerFullName}."
Act04_MQ_80_Nar_10,"(The alien releases a scream reverberating through the chamber, and the battle commences.)"

#,Boss05 reaching 2nd battle phase
Act04_MQ_80_Player_11,"Cassini, what's going on with the alien?"
Act04_MQ_80_AI_12,"You have destroyed enough alien-nanobot clusters to force the swarm into <color=#FFFF00>survival mode</color>. It is protecting the alien's version of a NanoStone. The TECC AI's DNA duplication skipped no details, which would explain the NanoStones you found in the mines."
Act04_MQ_80_AI_13,This new form is near-invincible... but requires massive energy to maintain. The swarm can only retain its concentrated protection for a limited time.
Act04_MQ_80_Player_14,Got it! Destroying the NanoStone will defeat the alien.
Act04_MQ_80_AI_15,As long as you can survive its attacks until you find an opening.
Act04_MQ_80_Player_16,Everything is riding on this! I have to try!
