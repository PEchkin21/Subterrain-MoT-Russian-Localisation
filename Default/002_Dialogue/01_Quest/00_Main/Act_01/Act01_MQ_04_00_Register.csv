Act01_MQ_04_00_Register_Nar_02,(The rugged-looking woman behind the desk holds up a finger while she finishes clicking on her keyboard. Her nameplate reads 'Katerina'. She seems to have a chip on her shoulder when she finally addresses you.)

Act01_MQ_04_00_Register_Nar_11,(Katerina interjects through the intercom.)

Act01_MQ_04_00_Register_David_18,"This will read data from your Omniscope lenses and complete your registration. Stand on the mark, and then look up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right as quickly as possible."
