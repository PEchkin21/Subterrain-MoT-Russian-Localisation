Act01_MQ_05_Player_01,I'm looking for a room I can use.
Act01_MQ_05_Lao_02,"Well, we recently finished cleanup in one of our rare solo rooms. Of course, something like that comes with a price tag, and we're already at beyond capacity, so sharing is common. "
Act01_MQ_05_Player_03,"I have a few credits, but you're making it sound like what I have is probably insufficient."
Act01_MQ_05_Lao_04,"Between you and me, I get an idiot in here every other day looking for a bed, and I usually have to turn them away. You've caught me on a nice day, though. "
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_05,(Mr. Lao looks you up and down. He doesn't seem impressed.)
Act01_MQ_05_Player_06,"Look, I just got out of cryostasis, so I'm hoping there's an agreement we can come to. I'm fragile right now. "
Act01_MQ_05_Lao_07,"Mr. Lao Rule #1: Work, earn credits, and trade them for goods, food, or a room to rent. Your choice since you earned them, but nothing comes for free... especially now that supplies from HQ are dwindling and everyone is scrounging for scraps."
Act01_MQ_05_Player_08,So where can I work to earn enough credits for your room?
Act01_MQ_05_Lao_09,"I run the Residential area, not a temp agency. <color=#FFFF00>I remember Alp saying something about a cave of mushrooms</color>, but you'd have to talk to him for details. I've already said more than I should have for free anyway. "
Act01_MQ_05_Player_10,"Please, Mr. Lao. For me to have the energy to work, I need to sleep. Can you make an exception?"
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_11,(Mr. Lao sucks his teeth and tilts his head. Your weakened state means you're no good to him in your current condition.)
Act01_MQ_05_Lao_12,"Well, don't say Mr. Lao isn't the most gracious man on Titan. I'll give you the room for now in exchange for a favor in the future. After that, though, you start paying just like everyone else. "
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_13,"(You hardly have the strength to respond, but you hope the favor doesn't involve more rats.)"

#,"장면이 페이드 되고, 라오 방에 위치."
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_14,"(Mr. Lao goes to his desk, opens a drawer, and takes out a keycard. As he approaches, he holds it out. But when you grab it, he doesn't let go.)"

#,"라오가 플레이어에게 다가와서 키를 건넴."
Act01_MQ_05_Lao_15,"By accepting this keycard, you fully acknowledge all terms and conditions of renting a room here and agree to fulfill a favor for Mr. Lao. If you agree, just say 'Aye.'"
Act01_MQ_05_Player_16,Aye.
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_17,(You receive <color=#66FFCC>Keycard: Personal Room</color> from Mr. Lao.)
Act01_MQ_05_Lao_18,"I'm not always this charitable, but you make sure to tell everyone what Mr. Lao did for you today. We must scratch each other's backs around here. But you must also start paying for this room in the very near future, or your room card will be deactivated. It would be unfair to the other tenants if they paid and you didn't have to, right? Now, follow me."
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_19,(Mr. Lao takes the lead and guides you to the door of your new living quarters.)

#,"방 앞에 도착하여 안내."
Act01_MQ_05_Lao_20,"Okay, here is your room. For now, sleep. Tomorrow, we talk favors and future payments."
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_21,"(As Mr. Lao leaves, your door makes an audible *CHUNK* sound, and a red light turns on to indicate it is now locked.)"
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_22,"(The room smells like a mix of chlorine and blood. Whatever happened to free up this room wasn't pretty and only recently scrubbed. It looks clean enough, though, and staying awake is getting more challenging by the second.)"

#,"침대에 눕고 대사 시작."
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_23,(You think about everything you went through today.)
Act01_MQ_05_Player_24,*sigh* What did I wake up to? Camp Huygen... the camp is in shambles.
Act01_MQ_05_Player_25,"One thing is for certain, though. This place runs on credits first and foremost. So tomorrow... *yawn*... I start earning my keep."
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_26,"(The humming of machines outside your window lull you into a trance, and silence eventually envelops you as your head hits the pillow.)"
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_27,(...)

#,"침대에서 일어나서 대사."
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_30,"(You wake up abruptly and take a moment to shake off the eeriness of your dream. You almost miss the nothingness of the cryo-pod, but it was also nice to dream again. Something is always better than nothing.)"
Act01_MQ_05_Nar_31,"(You stand, adjust your gear, and take a deep breath.)"
Act01_MQ_05_Player_32,Time to <color=#FFFF00>talk to Alp</color> about some fungus.

#,잠을 안자고 벗어나려는 경우 트리거 대사.
#,(Player tries to leave the area without sleeping in the bed)
Act01_MQ_05_Player_01,"I'm so tired, and that bed over there looks terribly inviting..."
