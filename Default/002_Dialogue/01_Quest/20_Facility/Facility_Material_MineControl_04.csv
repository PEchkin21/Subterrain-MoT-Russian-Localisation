MineControl_04_AI_03,Scanning...
MineControl_04_Nar_04,(...)
MineControl_04_AI_05,Your suspicions were correct. There is a secret door here that leads to a hidden room.

MineControl_04_AI_15,We should search the area to find out. Keep an eye out for any dead bodies.
MineControl_04_Player_16,"That's not exactly comforting, Cassini."
MineControl_04_AI_17,Noted. Should I update my humor protocols to be less morbid in the future?
